<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Here I will talk about the "dialect quiz shows" in China, which I think can be emulated in many other parts of the world.

<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">"Dialect quiz show"</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The "dialect quiz show" is a genre of TV game show that has become somewhat popular in Mainland China in the last few (?) years. Many provinces have their own dialect quiz shows. "Dialect" is a commonly used – but not very good – translation of 方言&nbsp;<i>fāngyán</i>, which can refer to any regional speech varieties that is not the standard. Genealogically related speech varieties which would be considered separate languages in the West are often considered&nbsp;</span></span>方言&nbsp;<i>fāngyán</i>&nbsp;of the same language from a Chinese point of view.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese#Comparison_with_Europe">The diversity amongst the Sinitic languages ("Chinese dialects") is comparable with the diversity amongst the Romance languages</a>, but in China the Sinitic languages are all regarded&nbsp;as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">方言&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">fāngyán</i><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;of the same Chinese language.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I don't know whether this dialect-quiz-show trend has spread to the (very few) TV-channels in Mainland China that broadcast in non-Chinese languages (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_China#Non-Standard_Chinese_satellite_television" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">e.g.</a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">);</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">here we are talking about dialect quiz shows in Sinitic languages.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">(From here onwards, except for the term <i>dialect quiz show</i>, I will just use the word <i>lect</i>&nbsp;to mean any language variety, and avoid the entire language-vs.-dialect debate.)&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two main types of dialect quiz shows: comprehension-oriented, and production-oriented. The comprehension-oriented quiz shows aim at exposing people to a wide variety of lects within a geographical range (especially lects that people are less likely to encounter), while production-oriented quiz shows aim at increasing the knowledge of one particular lect. There are are also other dialect game shows that differ from these two prototypes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The dialect quiz shows have raised the interest in regional lects, which are all loosing speakers to Standard Mandarin, in many cases alarmingly rapidly. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">For me, the dialect quiz shows are interesting for a number of different reasons:</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Some of them are entertaining, in a TV-show-kinda way, even if the lects that they quiz on are ones that I am less interested in, and have zero intelligibility of (I have to stick to the Chinese subtitles the entire time);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">They are interesting to the historical-linguistically-minded me; some of the quiz shows are formatted in a way (e.g. more explanations and discussions from the judges) that makes it easier for me to learn and think about sound changes and semantic changes within the Sinitic language family. Often you also get to learn about the cultures of different places, and sometimes you get to see picturesque video clips;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">For the comprehension-oriented shows, the contestants are quizzed on a wide range of lects; how well or not well the contestants cope with a particular question gives a proxy on the level of intelligibility of that lects to other Sinitic speakers. (Questions from some lects invoke significantly more 😨 s than others. Someone should just code the rate of correct/wrong answers for each lect);</span></li>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Comprehension-oriented dialect quiz shows</span></span></h2>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">In a comprehension-oriented quiz show, the contestants listen to or watch a monologue/ dialogue/ performance in a lect from somewhere nearby, and then they have to answer a question about the monologue/ dialogue/ performance, of which the intelligibility&nbsp;</span></span>can be anywhere between 100% to 0%. (It is most fun – and educational – when the contestants get caught in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">false-friend</a> traps set by the question designers.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br />The contestants give their answer in writing, on an electronic writing board in front of them. Some questions require the contestants to act out their answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Usually the contestants are also given the opportunity to further explain their answers verbally.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br />These shows are great, as you get to hear a wide range of lects that you would otherwise never encounter.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Here I will talk about three shows that I am more familiar with.&nbsp;</span></span><br />

(Obviously, the participants have to at least understand Standard Cantonese; many contestants and judges speak in Mandarin instead.) First season in 2014, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgIwOUqicjZ_zRzB0ckt8wbPF_FrwmrM">second season</a> in 2015, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgIwOUqicjbUSJD6fXuElr-JpMAl-dUa">third season</a> in 2016.</span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span></li>

During the competition, a question is read out, and one contestant from each team answers the question on their own (i.e. they cannot consult their team members). If their answer is correct, they remain for the next question. If their answer is incorrect, they are eliminated from the rest of the game. The winning team is the team that still has contestants remaining at the end. (There are special rules to prevent two or more teams all being eliminated at once, e.g. a question does not count if all teams are wrong, special games when only two teams are left.) The winning team of an episode advance to the semi-final.</span></span><br />

The team leader pre-selects three other people from their prefecture to be in their team. (Because having higher linguistic diversity in a team increases the likelihood of winning, the team-leaders often interpret this "from their prefecture" requirement very loosely.) The contestants get to play the entire episode, and the team that scores the most points advances to the semi-final.</span></span><br />

Also, because this show covers such a wide area, the MCs have to cater for viewers from many more provinces, and hence&nbsp;there is much less scope for the MCs to speak in lects other than Standard Mandarin.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><b>Production-oriented dialect quiz shows</b></span></div>
</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">In these shows, the contestants are tested on their knowledge of one particular lect. Most of the tasks require the contestants producing that lect "correctly", and sometimes also "entertainingly".<br /><br />As you can guess, these shows are aimed at people who have deep interest in a particular lect. The following are some examples of production-oriented quiz shows that I have watched a bit of:</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large; text-align: center;">
<li style="text-align: left;">福州话我最霸<i>&nbsp;Hók-ciŭ-uâ Nguāi Cói-bá</i>&nbsp;(I can only find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clT_Q1EV5NM">snippets</a>&nbsp;of this online). This seems to be a show in the early 2010s. This show tests contestants on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou_dialect">Hokchiu</a>, and the broadcasting language is Hokchiu.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">福建方言文化大赛<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.fjtv.net/folder6/folder60/folder67/folder1338/"><i>Fujian Dialect and Culture Competition</i></a>. This show has four streams for four different lects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian">Fújiàn</a> (Hokkien) province:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Min">Southern Mǐn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou_dialect">Hokchiu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Min">Eastern Mǐn</a>), Hinghwa (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-Xian_Min">Púxiān Mǐn</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changting_dialect">Chángtīng</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_Chinese">Hakka</a>. The best players in each stream then form teams of four contestants (one from each stream) to play in a combined quiz show.&nbsp;</span>The baseline broadcasting language is Standard Mandarin.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">阿拉乓乓响 <i>Aqla&nbsp;Pángpangxiang</i>&nbsp;(e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVlGfdH39L8&amp;t=473s">YouTube</a>), a contest on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese">Shanghainese</a>. Despite being a production-oriented quiz show on one single lect, the baseline broadcasting language is Standard Mandarin. For instance, the MC announces that contestants will get a yellow card (penalty) each time they speak Mandarin, <a href="https://youtu.be/p0mQBaaN5uQ?t=4m11s">in Mandarin</a>, and she continues to speak in Mandarin most of the time.&nbsp;</li>
</span></ul>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: center;">
</span><br />Similar to the comprehension-oriented quiz shows, the production-oriented quiz shows also have broadcasters and linguists/philologists as judges. However, unlike comprehension-oriented quiz shows where broadcasters from many different places are needed, production-oriented quiz show require very few judges.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Common game tasks include:</span></span></span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Reading out words or phrases on the screen. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/p0mQBaaN5uQ?t=5m23s">this Uyghur contestant reading out words/phrases in Shanghainese</a>. Native speakers do not necessarily do very well either&nbsp;(in this episode, all contestants are native speakers, except the first Uyghur contestant and the last Mandarin contestant), given that many speakers – especially younger speakers – are trained by the education system to associate literacy with only Mandarin. In most places people switch to Mandarin or a locally prestigious lect when they have to say something more formal or less common; they do not necessarily think how these rarer words are meant to be pronounced in their own lect; &nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Interpreting words and sentences from Mandarin to their lect, with as few Mandarin-influences as possible/reasonable. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/GRqxUZmOv8Y?t=9m22s">this contestant interpreting from Mandarin into his native Hokkien (Southern Mǐn)</a>. (Of cause, low competence in interpreting between two languages does not infer low competence in the two language);</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Interpreting an entire video clip. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/YiE8fRWlswU?t=2m2s">the same contestant interpreting from Mandarin into his native Hokkien (Southern Mǐn)</a>;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Quiz on language and oral/written literature;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Quiz on local social/cultural phenomena;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Guessing the meaning of a sentence pronounced badly by a person who does speak the lect (<a href="https://youtu.be/p0mQBaaN5uQ?t=49m3s" style="font-family: inherit;">example</a><span style="font-family: inherit;">). A variant of this is having a sentence pass through multiple non-speakers in a line of chinese-whispers-booths, before reaching a native speaker at the end, who then has to guess what the original sentence is;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Have one contestant describe a word/phrase shown on the screen to another contestant who cannot see the screen, and the latter has to guess that word/phrase.</span></span></li>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Other dialect game shows</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">A) There are dialect talent shows, where performances must involve speaking/singing in local lects (these shows can also include&nbsp;some game tasks like the ones discussed above). Examples are:</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">方言英雄&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ahtv.cn/v/lanmu/fyyx/index.html" style="font-family: inherit;"><i>Dialect Hero</i></a>&nbsp;in<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui" style="font-family: inherit;">Ānhuī</a>;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">疯狂杭州话&nbsp;<a href="http://tv.hoolo.tv/xhmz/fkhzh/"><i>Crazy Hangzhounese</i></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou">Hángzhōu</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">B) In Fújiàn there is 方言欢语游福建&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fjtv.net/folder6/folder60/folder67/folder613/?pp=20"><i>Dialect Fun through Fujian</i></a>, which is a <i>The Amazing Race</i>-type game show, except that 方言欢语&nbsp;<i>Dialect Fun</i>&nbsp;is not a contest: it is more a touristic show, and more about how the players cope with the tasks, most of which involve them learning the local lect. The two players, playing as a team, are taken to a city/town/village. They are given a clue to find the next checkpoint guardian. (There is no physical checkpoint to find; the checkpoint is just an unmarked person.) The clue is usually a word or phrase in the local lect, the meaning of which have to be figured out along the way. When they find the checkpoint guardian, they have to perform some task before they are given the next clue. Most of the checkpoint tasks are linguistic, e.g. learning and giving a small speech in the local lect, learning and performing a song in the local lect, solving a riddle in the local lect (the players will have to figure out what the riddle means first), learning a phrase in the local lect and use that as a pass-phrase to obtain some item from someone. Some tasks are not primarily linguistic, e.g. learning to do some traditional activity like tea ceremony or wood carving. During these traditional activities, the players are taught words associated with the activities, and the contestants might be tested on those words as part of the task.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">The relationship between the tasks are often not linear. For instance, one task might require them to collect various map pieces, which the players have to obtain from other checkpoints (which they have to find through clues, and each checkpoint has a task of its own). A song learnt at one checkpoint might be required at more than one checkpoint.</span></span><br />

<h2>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br />What makes them work, and where else they might work</span></h2>
</div>
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The competition amongst Mainland Chinese TV channels is cut-throat; there are more than 3000 TV channels in Mainland China. All provincial TV stations have at least one channel that can be viewed throughout the country, and some even have international version of their channels that you can pick up on foreign cable/satellite packages. (And despite YouTube being banned in Mainland China, </span>China Central Television [CCTV]&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit;">and some Chinese provincial TV networks have official YouTube channels.)&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">One way to stand out amongst the many provincial channels is to highlight local culture in a way that is accessible to audiences from all over the country. This is one of the reasons why the dialect quiz shows all have Standard Mandarin as the baseline broadcasting language, even for production-oriented quiz shows that focus on just one lect. (Besides that, there are also severe government restrictions on broadcasting in languages other than Standard Mandarin. As for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">谁语争锋&nbsp;</span><i style="text-align: center;">All about the Dialects</i><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;broadcasting in Cantonese, and that there is a Cantonese satellite TV channel in Mainland China: the Cantonese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Television_Cantonese_controversy#July_25.2C_2010_mass_assembly">literally said&nbsp;<i>f you</i></a>&nbsp;and continued to speak Cantonese.)</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The inspiration behind the comprehension-oriented quiz shows was perhaps the first season (2013) of 中国汉字听写大会&nbsp;<i>Chinese Characters Dictation Competition</i>&nbsp;on CCTV-1, which is like the Chinese version of the American spelling bee: contestants listen to a word or phrase in Standard Mandarin, and they have to write them correctly in Chinese characters. In Mainland China, the most successful TV network after CCTV is Hunan TV, the showbiz trend-setter in Mainland China. Hunan TV, in late 2013, adopted the format of the <i>Chinese Character Dictation Competition</i></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">, and have the contestants listen to the local lects in Húnán Province in its&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: center;">方言听写大会&nbsp;</span><i style="text-align: center;">Dialect Dictation Competition</i><span style="font-family: inherit;">. Many other provinces followed suit in 2014, and made them more entertaining. However, in 2016, despite being immensely popular,&nbsp;</span>多彩中国话&nbsp;<i style="font-family: inherit;">Splendid Chinese Language</i><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;was abruptly cancelled after nine (?) episodes (<i>Because China</i>). We will see whether there are more dialect quiz shows in 2017 and beyond.</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: large;">These shows are successful due to a number of reasons:</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">people clearly feel the endangerment&nbsp;of their regional lects, and they feel uneasy about their traditions not being passed on to younger generations;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">the entertainment value of the shows: people like jokes (e.g. words in another lect that sound "funny/wrong/rude" in the broadcasting language), and songs/dances/plays in lects that they care about;</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">audiences are listening to lects that they can relate to. So, although the intelligibility of the lects featured in the shows range from 100% to 0% (e.g. Cantonese speakers listening to Teochew is like, I guess, English speakers listening to Faeroese): <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

at least they are listening to lects from the same language family, and many would understand explanations given by the linguists afterwards, especially on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate">cognacy</a> between the words in question and the words in other lects that the audience know.

<span style="font-size: large;">I can see comprehension-oriented quiz shows being popular in many other parts of the world; the key is testing contestants</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;mostly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">on lects that are genealogically related (same family) to the lects that the audience understand or are interested in. Many European nation states have the right amount of lect variation for such shows to be interesting. There can also be pan-family/pan-region comprehension-oriented quiz shows. Some examples are:&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">

</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">the Celtic-language TV channels joining force to create a Pan-Celtic quiz show;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">a show covering the lects in the Dutch-speaking-sphere;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Auckland (ping: Māori Television) can easily have a Pan-Polynesian comprehension-oriented&nbsp;quiz show. (Perhaps also include Fijian and Rotuman, or even further.) A Māori production-oriented quiz show would also be nice. I guess Honolulu (ping: ʻŌiwi TV) would have no problem pulling in a Polynesian+Micronesian show;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">I think South Africa has a good amount of linguistic diversity for a comprehension quiz show.</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size: large;">Obviously, very few endangered languages have a TV station of its own. Some have broadcasting time with mainstream TV channels; some share a TV station with many other indigenous languages (e.g. Taiwan Indigenous Television). Even if it is not an hour-long quiz show, a 5 or 10 minute quizlet would still be fun.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Many endangered languages have radio broadcasting time, and radio language quiz shows are also entirely feasible. (Some of the TV shows mentioned above also have radio versions.)&nbsp;With the internet, it has becoming increasingly easy to broadcast in languages that in the past had no or very little chance of being heard by the wider audience. There are many different ways to have language quizzes for endangered languages in the media.</span><br />
