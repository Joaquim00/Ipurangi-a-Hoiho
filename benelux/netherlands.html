<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through the Netherlands. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about the Netherlands in that page are repeated here.</p>
	      <p>The Netherlands is known is <em>Nederland</em> in Dutch, <em>Nederlân</em> in Frisian, <em>Niederlande</em> in German, and <em>Pays-Bas</em> in French. The Netherlands is also commonly referred as <em>Holland</em> in many languages (e.g. <em>Hulanda</em> in Papiamento), when in fact Holland is just a region of the Netherlands (albeit the most properous region).</p>
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in the Netherlands. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in the Netherlands (plus Belgium and Luxembourg).</p>

<br/>
	      <p>Dutch operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
<li>NS <em>Nederlandse Spoorwegen</em> 'Dutch Railways' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Dutch national railway company; runs the majority of trains in the Netherlands.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/special-routes/intercity-direct.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct</a> (ICd) is a semi-high-speed service within the Netherlands. (ICd trains run on high-speed rail, some sections of which are only run by them or high-speed trains, but they are not capable of doing 200+ km/h.) For domestic travel, there is a surcharge on the Schiphol – Rotterdam high-speed line (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>). <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-brussels" target="_blank">International ICd</a> is an extension of the domestic ICd service: this Amsterdam – Brussels semi-high-speed service is run together with NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail; <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>).</li>
<li>There are also four InterCity's per day between The Hague and Brussels, also run together with NMBS/SNCB. This The Hague – Brussels IC, and the Amsterdam – Brussels ICd, are often referred to as the 'Benelux train'. (Despite the name, this international service has never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg.) For domestic trips within the Netherlands, other than the ICd surcharge, they have normal NS ticketing.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin" target="_blank">Amsterdam – Berlin InterCity</a> service is run together with DB (German Rail; <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245" target="_blank">iOS</a>). Domestic trips within the Netherlands has normal NS ticketing.</li>
<li>NS also runs the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line for <a href="http://www.rnet.nl/" target="_blank">R-net</a>, a brand of the provinces of Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Flevoland, and Utrecht in western Netherlands. It follows normal NS ticketing rules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.arriva.nl/" target="_blank">Arriva</a>: subsidiary of DB. Runs many regional trains in the Netherlands, especially in the east of the country. In the northeast, Dutch Arriva trains and ticketing rules extend into Weener and Leer (Ostfriesland) in Germany. (However, the railway bridge between Weener and Leer collapsed; replacement buses to/from Leer will run for some more years.)</li>
<li><a href="https://blauwnet.nl/" target="_blank">Blauwnet</a>: brand of the province of Overijssel in eastern Netherlands. Trains run by <a href="https://www.vechtdallijnen.nl/" target="_blank">Arriva</a> (Zwolle – Emmen, Almelo – Hardenberg), or <a href="https://www.syntusoverijssel.nl/" target="_blank">Keolis Nederland</a> (Zwolle – Kampen, Zwolle – Enschede, Zutphen – Oldenzaal). Keolis is majority owned by SNCF (French Rail).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.breng.nl/" target="_blank">Breng</a>: primarily a bus company, runs additional train services between Arnhem Centraal and Doetinchem, in parallel with Arriva's Arnhem Centraal – Doetinchem – Winterswijk service in eastern Netherlands. Follows Arriva's ticketing rules for this line.</li>
<li><a href="http://valleilijn.nl/" target="_blank">Valleilijn</a>: the Amersfoort – Ede-Wageningen train line is run by <a href="https://www.connexxion.nl/" target="_blank">Connexxion</a>, the parent company of Breng, and ultimately majority owned by the French state.</li>
</ul>
<p>German and Belgian operators with non-high-speed trains running in the Netherlands:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/" target="_blank">Eurobahn/Keolis Deutschland</a>: Hengelo – Bielefeld Hauptbahnhof (RB 61), Venlo – Hamm (Westfalen) (RE 13). The Hengelo line has two stations in the Netherlands: Hengelo, and Oldenzaal. Domestic travelling within the Netherlands follows Blauwnet/Keolis Nederland ticketing rules. (For the Venlo line, only Venlo is in the Netherlands.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bahn.de/regional/view/regionen/nrw/info/ueb_info.shtml" target="_blank">DB Regio NRW</a>: Enschede – Münster (Westfalen) Hauptbahnhof (RB 64), Enschede – Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (RB 51), Heerlen – Herzogenrath (RE 18). The Enschede lines have three stations in the Netherlands: Enschede, Enschede De Eschmarke, Glanerbrug. Domestic travelling on this line in the Netherlands follows Blauwnet/Keolis ticketing rules. In the south, the majority of the Heerlen – Herzogenrath line is in the Netherlands (only Herzogenrath is in Germany). Domestic travelling on this line in the Netherlands follows NS ticketing rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.abellio.de/" target="_blank">Abellio</a>: Arnhem Centraal – Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof (RE 19). This line has two stations in the Netherlands: Arnhem Centraal and Zevenaar. Domestic travelling in the Netherlands follows Arriva ticketing rules (despite Abellio being an NS subsidiary).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB</a> (Belgian Rail) runs two of its own local train services into the Netherlands: Maastricht – Liège-Guillemins – Hasselt, and Roosendaal – Antwerpen-Centraal – Puurs. The <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht.aspx" target="_blank">Maastricht line</a> has three stations in the Netherlands: Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, Eijsden. Domestic travelling in the Netherlands follows NS ticketing rules. (For the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/roosendaal.aspx" target="_blank">Roosendaal line</a>, only Roosendaal is in the Netherlands.)</li>
</ul>
<p>High-speed rail service operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (Amsterdam – Schiphol – Rotterdam – Antwerp – Brussels – Lille/Paris; seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille). It has its own ticketing. The largest shareholder of Thalys is SNCF, the second largest shareholder is NMBS/SNCB.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (Amsterdam – Rotterdam – Brussels – London). It has its own ticketing. The trip from London is a direct service. The Eurostar trains from the Netherlands stop for over an hour in Brussels, and passengers have to go through border and security controls at Brussels. (Eurostar usually puts customers from the Netherlands on Thalys services to Brussels.) Direct service from the Netherlands starts at the end of 2019 at the earliest. The majority shareholder of Thalys is SNCF.
<li><a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/ice-international" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (Amsterdam – Utrecht – Arnhem – Oberhausen – Duisburg – Düsseldorf – Cologne – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt/...Basel). Travelling on the ICE within the Netherlands requires just a normal domestic ticket, plus a ICE supplement (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>). International travel and domestic travel within Germany follow German long-distance ticketing. ICE International is a consortium between NS and DB.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-train-services">Types of train services</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, there are the following types of train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Sprinter</em> (term primarily used by NS) or <em>Stoptrein</em> (term only used by the other Dutch train companies): all-stops service; some Sprinter/Stoptrein services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services). Analogous to <em>RB</em> in Germany, and <em>L</em> or <em>S</em> in Belgium.</li>
	<li><em>Sneltrein</em>: a rarely encountered intermediate category; only operated by Arriva, all run in parallel with <em>Stoptrein</em> services on the same lines. From north to south:
		<ul>
			<li>Leeuwarden – Groningen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden – Emmen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden (peak supplementary service)</li>
			<li>(Maastricht Randwyck –) Maastricht – Heerlen</li>
		</ul>
		Analogous to <em>RE</em> in Germany. Or the old <em>IR</em> in Belgium.</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. All domestic InterCity services are operated by NS, except the Raalte – Enschede IC service which is operated by Keolis/Blauwnet. The Amsterdam – Berlin InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and DB. The The Hague – Brussels InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and NMBS/SNCB.</li>
	<li><em>Intercity direct</em> (ICd): semi-high-speed service; domestic Amsterdam Centraal – Schiphol Airport – Rotterdam Centraal (– Breda) is operated by NS; International ICd runs further from Breda to Brussels, and is operated jointly by NS and NMBS/SNCB.</li>
	<li>High-speed services:
		<ul>
	<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): between Amsterdam and Frankfurt/Basel</li>
	<li><em>Thalys</em>: between Amsterdam and Brussels/Lille/Paris</li>
	<li><em>Eurostar</em>: Amsterdam Centraal – Rotterdam Centraal – Brussels-Midi/Zuid – London St. Pancras International</li>
		</ul></li>

<p><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/special-routes/night-trains.html" target="_blank"><em>Nachtnet</em></a> services are domestic InterCity services that run between approximately 00:00 till 05:00. Utrecht – Amsterdam – Schiphol Airport – The Hague – Rotterdam are linked every night. During the weekend (the Friday–Saturday and Saturday–Sunday nights) there are one or two Nachtnet services to some other cities. Other than Nachtnet services, many ordinary train services also run till some time pass 00:00, or even 01:00 (see, e.g., <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/special-routes/night-trains.html" target="_blank">this</a>). One difference between these ordinary services and the <em>Nachtnet</em> services is that the ordinary services get <a href="#accessibility-issues">assisted boarding service</a> till the last train (at stations where this service is available), but the <em>Nachtnet</em> services has no assisted boarding service. <em>Nachtnet</em> services have the same ticketing as the other NS services. Tickets are valid for services with a scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, before 04:00 the day after the date printed on the ticket.</p>

	      <p>You may be interested in the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/reisinformatie/download-dienstregeling" target="_blank">printed timetables</a> of the domestic and international train services in the Netherlands. (The information in these printed timetables is not necessarily up to date, especially with international train services; always check with NS for the latest information. NS no longer publishes printed versions of the <em>spoorboekje</em>; printed versions by Rover/Treinreizigers.nl can be found <a href="https://treinwebshop.nl/categorie/treinboeken/spoorboekjes/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
	      <h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
<p>There are two main types of tickets: e-ticket, which comes with a barcode, and OV-chipkaart, which is an NFC ticket (contactless).</p>
	      <h4 id="e-tickets">E-tickets</h4>
	      <p>E-tickets are tickets bought from the websites or apps of public transport providers. For trains:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li> 
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li>
	      </ul>
<p>The NS domestic website/app sells tickets for all domestic train journeys, including trains that are not run by them. The websites/apps of the other public transport providers also sell products that are spcific to them. There is also the <a href="https://www.tranzer.com/en/home-en/" traget="_blank"></a>Tranzer</p> app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.data_lab.tranzer&hl=nl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/tranzer/id1204210982?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), where one can buy e-tickets for trains, some buses, and some taxi services in the Netherlands.</p>
	<p>E-tickets have a barcode. You have to provide travel details like the 'from' and 'to' stations (NS no longer issues tickets if you add a 'via' station in the journey planner), date, single/return (for domestic tickets, return is within a day), class of travel (first/second class), and number of passengers (1 to 9 or 10 passengers). Other than travel details, you also have to provide personal details of all the travellers, like name and date of birth (the ticket can only be used by the named person). Many e-tickets bought from the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic NS website</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International website</a> with a destination in Belgium or Germany, can have the E-ticket loaded to their respective app. Otherwise, an e-ticket has to be printed out on a piece of A4 paper. When using an e-ticket, you have to be able to show an ID if asked. The name on the ID and the name on the ticket have to match. Acceptable IDs are passport, national ID card, and driver's licence (the latter two probably refer to European ones).</p>
	<p>The domestic NS website/app does not give discounted e-tickets for the normal single/return train tickets. With the NS International website/app, it will automatically give you a range of available prices. You can also specify railway subscription(s) that you have, and the relevant discount(s) is/are automatically applied.</p>	      
	<p>A good deal that can be purchased from the domestic NS website is the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren" target="_blank">off-peak group ticket</a>.</p>
	      <p>When using an e-ticket, checking in and out at the check-in portals are not required. The barcode can be used to open closed gates at train stations. Not all gates can read e-ticket barcodes, but there is always at least one that can in each station that has closed gates. (Like other frequently used barcode scanners, the station gate barcode scanners do not necessarily work very well; you might have to make multiple attempts at scanning the barcode before the gate opens. Or try another gate. Or ask for help.)</p>

      <figcaption>The reader at this gate only reads OV-chipkaarts</figcaption></figure>
	      <p>Belgian tickets and Thalys/Eurostar/DB e-tickets to the Netherlands most usually have a barcode that can open gates at Dutch railway stations. (Not all stations have gates.) For other German tickets, see <a href="#germany">below</a>. If stuck, there are information poles near the gates, and you can press the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/special-routes/traveling-international-train.html" target="_blank">blue <em>i</em> button</a> for help; a staff member would then start speaking with you remotely (the other button on an information pole is a red SOS button for emergencies). Alternatively, try to seek the attention of a station attendant.</p>
	      <h4 id="ov-chipkaart">OV-chipkaart</h4>
<p>OV-chipkaarts are near-field communication (NFC) cards; you place an OV-chipkaart near the reader (within centimetres), the card is then read by the reader, and validated if everything is in order (the reader beeps and shows a green light). There are disposable OV-chipkaarts, and durable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<h5>Disposable OV-chipkaarts, and Dutch Rail ticket machines/ticket counters</h5>
<p>Disposable OV-chipkaarts are short-term tickets issued by train-ticket machines. At ticket counters, all domestic tickets and many international tickets issued there are also disposable OV-chipkaarts. <a href="https://www.ret.nl/en.html" target="_blank">Rotterdam</a> and <a href="https://en.gvb.nl/" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> also issue their short-term public transport tickets in the form of disposable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<p>NS has <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">three types of ticket machines</a>. Only the usual ticket machines – the ones that are blue at the top with an NS logo – sell disposable OV-chipkaart tickets. They also sell durable OV-chipkaarts. (The other two types of NS ticket machines, ones that are yellow at the top with the word <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em>, and narrow machines which say <em>saldo opladen</em>, are for people who already possess a durable OV-chipkaart.)</p>
<figure><a href="images/P_20180418_152227.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180418_152227.jpg" alt="machines at Rotteram Centraal P_20180418_152227.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
<figcaption>Some ticket machines at Rotterdam Centraal. From left to right: normal NS ticket machines, RET (Rotterdam public transport) ticket machines, NS <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em>machines.</figcaption></figure>
	<p>You can get tickets to and from all train stations in the Netherlands from NS ticket machines, even on (non-high-speed) train services run by other Dutch/German/Belgian train companies. In some regions, the Arriva ticket machines also sell tickets to and from all train stations in the Netherlands, also in the form of disposable OV-chipkaarts. (See what the machine says.)</p>
	<p>NS ticket machines and the normal NS ticket counters sell the same range of single/return tickets, and charge the same ticket-issuing fee. For domestic single/return tickets, the issuing cost of a disposable OV-chipkaart is €1, which is added to the normal ticket price. This €1 fee does not apply to, e.g., <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> (children's ticket), <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-fiets" target="_blank">bicycle ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-hond" target="_blank">dog ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/alleen-te-koop-via-station-of-kaartautomaat/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a> (for the NL/BE/DE tripoint region), and international tickets. The NS ticket machines and the normal NS ticket counters can handle tickets to many destinations in Belgium and Luxembourg, and some closer-by destinations in Germany plus Berlin (see <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/destinations-purchasable-at-ticket-machines" target="_blank">here</a> for the list of possible destinations). They no longer sell tickets to the Belgian Rail destinations in Lille area in France. As for high-speed-rail tickets, they can only print full-fare ICE tickets to destinations along the ICE line to Frankfurt (no seat reservation), and they cannot handle Thalys or Eurostar tickets to Belgium or further.</p> 
	<p>Other than the normal NS ticket counters, there are seven <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/tickets-services/opening-hours-ticket-and-service-shops" target="_blank">NS International ticket offices</a> where you can purchase the full range of international tickets that NS International offers. However, for international tickets that the NS ticket machines cannot handle, the NS International offices charge a <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/stations-service-offices" target="_blank">service fee</a> of €7.5 per person, to a maximum of €22.50 per booking. (It is best to purchase tickets online in general.) Most NS International ticket offices also have self-service computers where you can make your own booking online through the normal NS International website (no service fee), and print the ticket(s) out.</p>
	<p>With an NS ticket machine, you can switch between Dutch and English language. The main screen has three main options: One-way ticket, Day return ticket, and Other products. When purchasing a domestic one-way/return ticket:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the 'from' station is by default the station where the machine is located, but you can also change the 'from' station by pressing the 'from' button.</li>
		<li>the most popular 'to' stations are displayed. If your intended destination is not on the list, you have to key in the first one or two letters of the name of the station, and then a list of stations of those letters will appear. Press the button with the name of your inteded destination. Some destinations are not train stations; they combine <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/overige-kaartjes/p/trein-tram-bus-enkel" target="_blank">train and tram/bus travel</a>. For instance, if you look for destinations that begin with 'E', there are 'Efteling' (theme park) and 'Eindhoven Airport'; tickets to these include travel on train(s) and connecting bus(es). Not explained in the English page is that there are 'Arnhem Centraal +Bus' and 'Nijmegen +Bus' options, combining train trip to/from Arnhem Centraal and/or Nijmegen, and Breng buses to/from these stations. (This is meant to be a trial, but these two +Bus options have not been withdrawn so far.)</li>
		<li>choose the date, class of travel (first or second class), and number of passengers. For domestic return tickets, the return journey has to be made within the day. A ticket is valid for trains of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is before 04:00 the following day. If you want to travel after that, you need another ticket that is valid for that day.
		<li>pay. Ticket machines DO NOT take banknotes. Some machines take coins. All machines take bank cards and credit cards (V PAY, Maestro, Visa, Mastercard; €0.5 surcharge for credit card). When using cards, the flow of procedures is: insert card, wait, withdraw card when it tells you to, input PIN code, press OK. Then the ticket comes out of the machine if the transaction is successful. (Visa and Mastercard are now accepted at all ticket machines and online. Foreign credit cards seem to work OK. I have seen bankcards from EU but non-Euro countries not working at NS ticket machines.)</li>
	      </ul>		
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180523_144607.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180523_144607.jpg" alt="Initial screen P_20180523_144607.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
<figcaption>Choose one of these three options at the initial screen; alternatively, if you already have a durable OV-chipkaart, place that at the card reader to the bottom right</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180523_144617.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180523_144617.jpg" alt="Day return button P_20180523_144617.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
<figcaption>Pressing the 'Day return' button, you get a list of the most frequent destinations (here from Arnhem Centraal), or you type in the first one or two letters of your intended destination; after the destination is put in, the departure station can be changed if needed</figcaption></figure>
	<p>For domestic tickets, Dutch ticket machines no longer give a 'via' option. (The NS website/app gives you a 'via' option, but this is only for journey planning; tickets cannot be purchased if there is a 'via' destination.) If NS thinks that your journey involves two similar routes operated by different companies, it will list the two options, show you the price difference, and ask you to specify the route you want to take. It also gives you a third option, which gives a ticket that allows travelling on either route, paying the price of the more expensive option.</p>
	      <p>To purchase an international ticket from a ticket machine, the option for purchasing international tickets is embedded within the 'other tickets' option at the initial screen. (Alternatively, if you have pressed the One-way or Day return option at the initial screen, you will only discover, after many steps, that these options are only for domestic tickets; a red button for purchasing international tickets will eventually appear in the bottom left corner.)</p>
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180523_144636.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180523_144636.jpg" alt="Other products button P_20180523_144636.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
<figcaption>This is the screen after pressing the 'Other products' button</figcaption></figure>
	<p>For international tickets, after inputting the 'from' and 'to' stations, a 'via' button will appear, showing you the default frontier point that you cross the border at. If you press the 'via' button', very often it gives you a list of alternative frontier points where you can cross the border, and then it gives you the price for each option. (Non-high-speed international rail tickets always show you specific frontier point(s) that you have to cross a border at.)</p>	
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180527_102617.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180527_102617.jpg" alt="Hengelo Berlin P_20180527_102617.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>

<figcaption>If you press the 'via' button, in this case, the machine gives you a choice of the Bentheim frontier and five other frontiers along the Dutch–German border</figcaption></figure>
	      <p>NS ticket machines, and the usual NS ticket counters, no longer give discounted tickets; all tickets, both domestic and international, are full fare tickets. To benefit from <em>samenreiskorting</em> (see <a href="#samenreiskorting">below</a>), one needs to have a durable OV-chipkaart.</p>
	      <p>There are German and Belgian train ticket machines at certain Dutch stations near the border. See the <a href="#germany">Germany</a> and <a href="#belgium">Belgium</a> sections below.</p>
<h5>Durable OV-chipkaart</h5>
<p>Durable OV-chipkaarts are valid for five years. For regular public transport in European Netherlands, they are valid on all regular passenger trains, metros, trams, the vast majority of buses (e.g. not on Schiermonnikoog Island), and some ferries. They are also valid on the Arriva trains (and replacement buses) to Weener and Leer in Germany (notice the Arriva OV-chipkaart readers in <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Weener#/media/File:Weener_station_met_Arriva_Spurt_IV.jpg" target="_blank">Weener</a> and <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Leer#/media/File:DB_kaartautomaat_VII.JPG" target="_blank">Leer</a>), and some cross-border buses.</p>
	      <p>There are anonymous OV-chipkaarts and personal OV-chipkaarts. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts can be used by anyone, and the normal retail price is €7.5. (This is just the retail price, not a deposit!) Each OV-chipkaart can only be used by one person at a time; children 4 years old or above need their own ticket/OV-chipkaart. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts are sold at ticket machines, ticket counters, and at some shops (search for OV-chipkaart sales points <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">here</a>). In Germany, they can purchased at at least: a) the Arriva ticket machines in Weener and Leer in the north, b) in <a href="https://avv.de/de/limburg/tickets-preise#tickets-preise-10031" target="_blank">Aachen/Herzogenrath</a>.</p>
<p>Personal OV-chipkaarts is for one particular person, whose details and photo are printed on the card. A personal OV-chipkaart also cost €7.5, but it is given out for free in some cases, e.g., when you order certain <em>annual</em> <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS subscriptions</a>. Otherwise, for people with an address in Benelux or Germany, one can order a personal OV-chipkaart from the <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart website</a>. (For people living elsewhere, <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/everything-about-travelling/different-types-of-passenger/tourists.htm" target="_blank">it is complicated</a>, and more expensive.)</p> 
	<p>One functional difference between anonymous and personal OV-chipkaarts is that subscriptions usually require personal OV-chipkaarts. See <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/which-card-is-right-for-you.htm" target="_blank">this page</a> on other functional differences between an anonymous and personal OV-chipkaart.</p>
	      <p>Credit (i.e. money) can be added to a durable OV-chipkaart through ticket machines of <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">NS</a>, other Dutch railway companies, and many other public transport providers. There are also many free-standing OV-chipkaart terminals (they are yellow in colour) where one can add credit to an OV-chipkaart with a bank card. On the internet, one can add credit, or order certain tickets or subscriptions to an OV-chipkaart. However, after an online transactions, one needs to go to a ticket machine, or one of the many dedicated OV-chipkaart terminals, to load the product into the OV-chipkaart. Search <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">here</a> for OV-chipkaart service points.</p>
	      <p>(On the other hand, asking for a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/applying-for-a-credit-refund.htm" target="_blank">refund</a> from an OV-chipkaart is not straightforward. An anonymous OV-chipkaart that has not yet expired can have its credit refunded at service counters of public transport providers if the credit is under €30.)</p>
	      <p>Credit is automatically deducted as one checks the card in and out during one's journey. As one checks in at a check-in portal at a station (or tram/bus/ferry), a deposit is deducted from the card. The deposit is between €0 to €20, depending on the public transport company, type of OV-chipkaart, type of subscription that one has, etc. (Without an NS subscription, the deposit for catching NS trains is €20! See <a href="http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/OV-chipkaart#Instaptarief" target="_blank">here</a> for what the various companies charge for the deposit.) One can only successfully check in if, after the deposit, the credit in the OV-chipkaart is not under negative €4. When one checks out, a refund is given if the fare is lower than the deposit, or extra credit is charged if the fare is higher than the deposit.</p>
	       <p>If you want to change the class of travel temporarily, you can do this <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-2-1" target="_blank">at a ticket machine</a>. The change expires on 04:00 the following day, unless you cancel it earlier. If you want to change the class of travel permanently, read the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/klantenservice/wijzigen/klasse-wisselen.html" target="_blank">Dutch page</a>, or ask at a ticket office.</p>
	      <p>With a durable OV-chipkaart, checking out and then back in again at the same station within 35 minutes is consider a transfer. (One long journey with transfers is cheaper than the same route covered by shorter separate journeys.) Take note, that when you check in again, the balance in the card could have gone too low for the deposit.</p>
	<p>To cancel a check-in, the deposit is refunded if one checks out again at the same station within 60 minutes.</p> 
	<p>With NS, one cannot check out within 100 seconds of checking-in; this is to prevent people from double-tapping the card, accidentally checking out after they have checked in. (You can also use this method to check whether you have already checked in. Another method is to check your travel history at a ticket machine.)</p>
<p>If you have forgotten to check in, try to check in before you step into a train. (In places with open gates, remember to check in on the 'check-in side', i.e. the side that is outside the paid area.) If you are already inside a train, contact the conductor. If not, you risk a fine of €50. (Conductors might be lenient to you if you have a subscription from their company, if you have forgotten to check in no more than a few times in a year. In other cases, good luck.)</p> 
	<p>If you have forgotten to check out, you can go back to the station where you ended your journey and check out there within six hours of the last check-in. If not, go to a service counter of the public transport provider and ask for help. Failing that, try contacting <a href="https://www.uitcheckgemist.nl/?locale=en" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart</a>. For people with a personal OV-chipkaart or an NS business card, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/nsextra/aanmelden?1" target="_blank">service</a> that, amongst other things, alerts you if you have forgotten to check out.</p>
<p>One can check the credit in a card, or the travel history of the card, at ticket machines. Or at the OV-chipkaart <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm#/" target="_blank">website</a>/app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.tls.ovchip" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ov-chipkaart/id798908346" target="_blank">iOS</a>) if the card is linked to an account registered with the OV-chipkaart website.</p>
	     <p><em>Abonnementen</em> and 'peak time': <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS</a> and other public transport providers have various subscriptions that give discounted or unlimited travel of some sort. When peak/non-peak is referred to, <em>non-peak</em> is most usually 18:30–06:30 and 09:00–16:00 on weekdays, and the whole day on the weekend and holidays. On non-holiday weekdays: a) you can check in with non-peak rate a few (five?) minutes before 09:00 or 18:30, when the non-peak rate officially starts; b) the non-peak rate is valid as long as the scheduled departure time of the train that you catch, at the station where you board the train, is before 06:30 or 16:00. The non-peak rate remains valid until you step out of that train.</p>
	      <p id="samenreiskorting"><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/combined-travel-discount.html" target="_blank"><em>Samenreiskorting</em></a>: if you have an NS subscriptions (except Kids Vrij), you can take three other travellers along on trains in the Netherlands (except Thalys/Eurostar), and they enjoy 40% discount during off-peak. These co-travellers need to activate the <em>samenreiskorting</em> option in their own OV-chipkaart beforehand, through a ticket machine. There is the option of having this status once in a day, or twice in a day (e.g. for a return journey). They need to be travelling with you during their entire trip to enjoy this status. A <em>samenreiskorting</em> status expires 35 minutes after checking out; in other words, a <em>samenreiskorting</em> status is maintained with a succesful transfer. For international tickets booked with NS International (except Thalys/Eurostar), there is an option to apply <em>samenreiskorting</em>, and the discount is automatically applied to the section in the Netherlands <em>off full-fare tickets</em>. (I do not know what the situation is with the German/Belgian local trains that run in the Netherlands.)</p>
	      <h5>Other forms of NFC tickets</h5>
	      <p>The trial for <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ovchipmobiel.htm" target="_blank">OV-chip mobiel</a> (OV-chipkaart system with NFC-enabled smart phones) ends on 15 June 2018. They are analysing the results, and this type of payment may be relaunched in the future.</p>
	      <p>As far as I know, there is nowhere in the Netherlands where you can use a contactless bankcard/creditcard to check in and out with public transport. (Many buses and trams are cash-less, while others are aiming to become cash-less in 2018. Many  buses/trams have bank/credit card payment terminals.)</p>
	      <h4 id="promotional-tickets-and-tourist-tickets">Promotional tickets and 'tourist tickets'</h4>
	      <p>NS runs various promotional tickets (but you'll need Dutch reading skills). Some are sold through its own <a href="https://www.ns.nl/dagje-uit" target="_blank">leisure site</a>, while others are sold in coorporation and through other physical or online stores. One place where these various deals are summarised is <a href="https://www.treinreiziger.nl/category/treinkaartjes/" target="_blank">treinreiziger.nl</a>. The ones that are sold at physical stores can be a disposable OV-chipkaart, or a code which you turn into an e-ticket on the internet (they come with instructions, in Dutch).</p>
	      <p>NS sells the following 'tourist tickets' (anyone can purchase them):</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/amsterdam-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam Travel Ticket</a>: €16/€21/€26 for 1/2/3 days. One return journey (?) on the train between Schiphol Airport and {the Amsterdam– stations, or Duivendrecht}, unlimited travel on <a href="https://en.gvb.nl/" target="_blank">GVB</a> trams/buses/metros/ferries, and the Connexxion <a href="https://connexxion.nl/amsterdam-airport-express/1241" target="_blank">airport express bus 397 or N97</a>. (Cost-wise, this is comparable to GVB's own 24/48/72 hour tickets €7.5/€12.5/€17.5, plus €8.5 worth of train travelling. Check the rules carefully.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/uitleg-overige-producten/p/amsterdam-region-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam region travel ticket</a>: €18.5/€26/€33.5 for 1/2/3 days. Valid for unlimited trips on NS trains, and buses/trams/metros/ferries run by <a href="https://en.gvb.nl/" target="_blank">GVB</a>, <a href="http://www.ebs-ov.nl/" target="_blank">EBS</a>, <a href="https://www.connexxion.nl/" target="_blank">Connexxion</a> in the 'Amsterdam region'. See also explanations from <a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/public-transport/region-day-ticket" target="_blank">I amsterdam</a>. The following shows the validity area for train travel. (Click the map to open a larger version in another tab/window.)

	      <figcaption>Railway stations within the validity area of the Amsterdam region travel ticket (area within the red dotted loop). Only Sprinter services are shown; InterCity and Intercity direct services between stations (names in bold) within this region are also valid.</figcaption></figure></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/holland-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Holland travel ticket</a>: €39 'off-peak' (i.e. not during 06:30–09:00 weekdays), €55 whole-day, travel on all Dutch train and bus/tram/metro for one day. (€39 is on the expensive side, and €55 is too-expensive; but it is convenient for tourists.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart" target="_blank">Day ticket</a>: €50.6, unlimited travel on Dutch trains for an entire day. (Too expensive. You can do much better with promotional tickets.)</li>
	<li id="euregio"><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/overige-kaartjes/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a>: €18.5, unlimited travel for one day on buses and many train lines in southern Dutch Limburg province (Roermond and further south), Belgian Limburg and Liège provinces, and Aachen region in Germany. During the weekend and holidays, it is valid for two adults and three children under 12 years old. Best if you bring the <a href="https://avv.de/de/service/downloads?file=files/avv/files/tickets/flyer/euregioticket.pdf" target="_blank">brochure</a> along, as some train conductors / bus drivers might not know what it is (speaking from experience). Check very carefully what train and bus lines are and are not covered in each province/region. In the map of the brochure: a) with trains, the blue dotted lines are railway lines that the Euregio ticket is valid on, while the grey dotted lines are lines where it is NOT valid on. In Germany, it is only valid on local trains (S-Bahn, RB, and RE). It is also not valid on Thalys, ICE, and EuroNight; b) with buses, the Euregio ticket is valid on all buses in this region (but check the range of public transport operators listed, lest you board a bus that came in from another area). The red lines are just some example bus lines.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h4 id="check-in-portals">Check-in portals</h4>
<p>If you hold an e-ticket, this section does not concern you; you do not need to check in or out. The barcode in your e-ticket (on a piece of paper, or in a mobile app) can be used to open closed gates at stations. There is at least one gate in each station that can read e-ticket barcodes.</p>
	<p>For holders of OV-chipkaarts: there are two types of check-in portals: poles and gates. The check-in poles are just standing structures where you tap your card for checking in or out. The same pole can be used for either checking in or out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, check-in gates have barriers which, if closed, restrict access to the platforms, and only open as one checks in or out with an OV-chipkaart. One side of the gate has a card reader for checking in, and the other side has a card reader for checking out. (Some stations have gates that are not closed, for at least part of the day. You still need to check in or out at these open gates.) Whether stations have gates or not is not relative to the size of a station; some very small stations have gates, while some large stations do not have gates. This <a href="https://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1522750534329/content/assets/ns-nl/voorwaarden-folders/2018/tariefeenheden-vz-2018-update-april.pdf" target="_blank">map of tariff units</a> (2018 april) shows stations with gates with a red symbol next to the name of a station.</p>
<p>Different train companies use different check-in portals. There are four systems of check-in portals: NS, Arriva, Blauwnet, and Valleilijn. When catching trains of these four companies/brands, use the corresponding check-in portals. For companies other than these four, use the non-NS ones that are present, except for these three that use NS portals: a) in the west, R-net Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn (which is run by NS; this train line only connects with other NS-run train lines, so no need to do anything when changing to/from NS trains), b) in the south, NMBS/SNCB Maastricht – Eijsden, and c) in the south, DB Regio NRW Heerlen – Eygelshoven Markt. (Information in 2018; c, and perhaps b, will change in 2019.) This information is displayed in the <a href="#passenger-rail-service-operators">operators map</a> and the <a href="#localmaps">local train maps</a> above.</p>
<p>There are not many stations where two systems intersect; the vast majority of them are in the east of the country. There is only one station, Zutphen, where three systems intersect. If you change trains within one system, you do not need to check out and in again. (Except in rare cases where there are closed gates between the platforms that you have to reach.) If you change trains belonging to different systems, there are check-in poles of each system standing next to each other on the platforms; you check out of one system, and then in with the other system. Checking out and in again within 35 minutes at the same station is considered a transfer.</p>
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180527_093350.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180527_093350.jpg" alt="Zutphen check-in portals P_20180527_093350.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
	<figcaption>Check-in poles on the platform at Zutphen; from left to right: Arriva, NS, and Blauwnet</figcaption></figure>      
<p>There are some stations where NS and metro trains share the same paid area, or even an island platform; you can find their respective check-in poles standing next to each other for transfering.</p> 
<p>All metro stations have OV-chipkaart ticket gates (except metro stops that are shared with trams; see below). On the other hand, with buses/trams/ferries, their card readers are inside the vehicle; you have to check in and out of each individual bus/tram/ferries that you board. BE VERY CAREFUL when changing between metros and trams: there are some stops served by both metros and trams, with a different height of platforms; the card readers for metro are on the platform or somewhere else, while the card reader for trams are inside the vehicle. You have to check out of one and in with the other when changing between them, even if they are of the same company, and don't get them mixed up.</p>

	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>: travellers can travel on the ICE service domestically in the Netherlands (Amsterdam Centraal – Utrecht Centraal – Arnhem Centraal) with a normal domestic ticket/OV-chipkaart, plus an ICE supplement. The supplement is €2.4, and can be purchased as an e-ticket, a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart. The ICE supplement is not applicable to passengers with an NS subscription (that is valid on the section travelled on), NS-business card, student subscription, or children travelling on Railrunner or Kids Vrij. The ICE supplement is also not applicable to international ICE tickets to/from the Netherlands.</li>
	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>: when travelling domestically in the Netherlands (on either the domestic or international Intercity direct service), there is an Intercity direct supplement on the high-speed rail between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal. The ICd supplement is €2.4, and it can be purchased online as an e-ticket, or from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee). For people with a durable OV-chipkaart, there are ICd supplement poles at Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam Centraal, and Breda, where you can tap your durable OV-chipkaart once before you board the train. (DO NOT tap the ICd supplement pole again after you get off the train.) This year (2018) the ICd supplement is temporarily lowered to €1.4 if it is paid by tapping an ICd supplement pole DURING OFF-PEAK. The ICd supplment is not applicable to passengers with an international ticket to/from/through Belgium that is valid between Schiphol and Rotterdam.</li>

	      <h4 id="children-and-seniors">Children and seniors</h4>
	<p>0 to 3 year-olds do not need to pay, and do not need to have a ticket; they do not have the right to occupy a seat.</p> 
<p>Children 4 to 11 years can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket, which costs €2.5, for one day of unlimited train travel. It can be purchased as an e-ticket from the NS website, as a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing cost), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart (each OV-chipkaart can only be used by one person at a time). With a Railrunner ticket, a child 4 to 11 years old: a) can travel independently in second class(!); or b) has to be accompanied by an adult 18 years or older with a valid ticket in first class; each such adult can accompany at most three children, each with their own Railrunner ticket.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for people with an NS subscription, they can get <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/kids-vrij.html" target="_blank">Kids Vrij</a> subscriptions for at most three children, each costing €0.01 a year (in 2018). The only extra cost is €7.5 if they do not already have a personal OV-chipkaart. A child travelling on Kids Vrij has to be accompanied by a passenger 12 years or older with a valid ticket. Each such older passenger can accompany at most three children, each with their own Kids Vrij subscription.</p>
	<p>Railrunner and Kids Vrij are valid for all train travel in the Netherlands (except Thalys and Eurostar). If it is in an OV-chipkaart, check in and out as usual. Children on these do not have to pay the ICE supplement or the ICd supplement. For international travels: a) in Germany, with <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/familie/fahrkarten_fuer_kinder.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>, children under 6 do not need a ticket; older children under 15 years old can have their names added to their parent's or grandparent's ticket, and these children travel for free; otherwise tickets for 6-14 year-olds are half the adult price; b) for <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/reduction/children.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium</a>, 0–3 year olds do not need to pay. For 4–11 year olds, each passenger 12 years or older with a valid ticket can take along four such children along for free; otherwise, they require a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/children-youth/one-time/ticket-child.aspx" target="_blank">child ticket</a>; c) for <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/la-gratuit%C3%A9-de-transport/enfants" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>, children 12 or younger do not need to pay.</p>
	      <p>There are no special single or return tickets for students or seniors. However, there are special subscriptions for students. Seniors get extra privilages with some of the usual subscriptions; see <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/keuzedagen.html" target="_blank">Keuzedagen</a>.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-detour-and-fares">Breaking, detours, and fares</h3>
<p>Except for non-flexible high-speed-rail tickets, breaking of journey is allowed. Feel free to stop at an intermediate point. In the Netherlands, a ticket (a disposable OV-chipkaart, or a paper ticket issued in other countries) is valid for train services (on the designated route) of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is earlier than 04:00 the following day. Durable OV-chipkaarts need to be checked out within six hours of the last check in, and checking in again within 35 minutes of the last check-out is considered a transfer (a continuation of the same journey).</p>
<p>NS and the Leeuwarden/Groningen lines of Arriva charge fares based on 'tariff units' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1522750534329/content/assets/ns-nl/voorwaarden-folders/2018/tariefeenheden-vz-2018-update-april.pdf" target="_blank">map (April 2018)</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/consumer-rates.html" target="_blank">rates</a>; for discounted rates, NS rounds to the nearest 10 cents, while Arriva rounds to the nearest 1 cent). Each unit is roughly 1km in distance, but some sections charge more tariff units than actual distance. 0–8 units cost the same, and the price increases with each unit unitl 200 units. Journeys within the Netherlands that are longer than 200 units are charged 200 units. Other companies/lines have tariffs based on the actual distance in km, plus a flagfall. See the tables of second-class full-fare tariffs <a href="http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/OV-chipkaart#.28Kilometer.29tarieven_trein_2e_klas" target="_blank">here</a>; if the <em>basistarief</em> 'flagfall' is not listed, the full-fare flagfall is €0.90 in 2018. (If a journey involves changes between companies, only the flagfall of the first company applies, so the price can be different from that of the return journey along the same route.)</p>
<p>If a ticket only states a 'from' station and a 'to' station, you are meant to take the shortest possible route between the 'from' station and the 'to' station; see what the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">NS journey planner</a> suggests. If NS thinks that there are two reasonable routes for your journey, and each involving trains of different companies, the ticket machine/website/app will show you the price difference, and ask you which option you want to take. There is also a third option, which is paying the higher price, and you can take either route. (On the other hand, if you have a promotional e-ticket where any single/return journey costs the same, they are probably not too fussed about which route you take.)</p> 
	<p>Near two opposite ends of a railway loop, the tariff units are often configured so that it cost the same to travel through either side of the loop, despite slight difference in actual distance. For instance, an NS ticket from Amsterdam Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal allows the traveller to travel on either the faster InterCity via Den Haag HS (the western route), or the slower Sprinter via Breukelen (the eastern route), despite the travel distance being not exactly the same. The tariff units are configured in a way so that it is 86 units on both routes (second class full fare €15.4). The new Intercity direct (ICd) travels between Amsterdam and Rotterdam on a much shorter route, but the base fare is also 86 units. (On top of that, a €2.4 <a href="#surcharges">ICd supplement</a> is charged.) Check route suggestions and price information given by the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">NS journey planner</a>.</p>
<p>When there are track works or accidents, which affect the journey stated in your ticket, you can use your ticket as usual, and take the detour recommended by the railway companies. If you're using a durable OV-chipkaart, you are meant to check in and out as usual along your detour if a change of system is involved. Train conductors have hand-held devices which have real time information on track works and accidents.</p>

Many local trains are wheelchair-accessible. On the other hand, most faster trains are unfortunately not. Travel assistance is available at many stations; railway staff can set up ramps for pre-booked passengers. You need to make a request at least one hour beforehand (it is said that with online bookings, in some cases less than one hour is OK), giving them the details of your intended travel (date, time of departure, departure and arrival stations). Other than the usual telephone number of +31 30 2357822, you can make a request through the NS app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), or through <a href="https://www.ns.nl/reisassistentie">ns.nl/reisassistentie</a> (you need a Mijn NS account).

</ul>	   
	      <h3 id="germany">German trains and ticketing in the Netherlands</h3>
	<p>Several German rail services extend into the Netherlands. For domestic trips within the Netherlands on these trains, Dutch ticketing applies: OV-chipkaarts can be used, and the NS-issued normal tickets are valid. (However, with promotional tickets, it is less clear to me; read the conditions of the promotional ticket carefully.) Within Germany or for cross-border travels, German ticketing applies. (The only place where Dutch ticketing extends into Germany is the northernmost cross-border line between Groningen and Weener/Leer. Going international on this line, NS and DB price this as an international trip, while using OV-chipkaart or Arriva e-ticket gives a better price.)</p>
	<p>The most important distinction in train types in Germany is that between <em>Fernverkehr</em> 'long distance transport', and <em>Nahverkehr</em> 'short distance transport', or local trains. The commonest types of long distance trains are Intercity-Express (ICE), Intercity (IC), and EuroCity (EC). The commonest types of local trains are Interregio-Express (IRE), Regional-Express (RE), Regionalbahn (RB), and S-Bahn (S). Most usually, long-distance trains have different pricing from local trains. This is similar to France, but different from Benelux, where InterCity's have the same pricing as local trains. (There are a few exceptional sections of long-distance services where local-service pricing applies.)</p>
	<p>As for German long-distance services in the Netherlands, there is the Amsterdam – Frankfurt (/Basel) ICE service, and the Amsterdam – Berlin IC service. International travel on these services follows German-type long-distance ticketing rules, which have dynamic pricing. (You can book these either through <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a> or <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>.) For international tickets that involve at least one section of long-distance train service in Germany, <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/germany/flexible-fare.shtml" target="_blank"><em>Flexpreis</em></a> (full fare, flexible), and <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/europe/saver-fare-europe.shtml" target="_blank"><em>Sparpreis Europa</em></a> (saver fare, not flexible) are offerred. <em>Sparpreis</em> fluctuates, and it can run out. With <em>Sparpreis Europa</em>, it gives free train travel for a not-very-long distance within the Netherlands to/from the station that you board/deboard the ICE or IC Berlin service. Beyond that 'free connecting distance', the price increases in increments of €10. For instance, for a journey on the IC from Berlin to Deventer, a connecting train from Deventer to Arnhem Centraal is often free. However, going just a bit further to Nijmegen can cost €10 more. The 'free connecting distance' seems to fluctuate; when booking <em>Sparpreis Europa</em>, it is worth checking where the 'free connecting distance' for a particular ICE/IC/EC service ends. (The 'free connecting distance' is not very far in the Netherlands; this is unlike Belgium, where the free connecting distance covers nearly the whole country from Brussels/Liège.)</p>
	<p>As for German local train services, there are many tickets that are valid for local trains and other public transport throughout a German state, or more locally at the level of a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbund</em></a> 'transport authority'. There are two German states that border the Netherlands: <em>Niedersachsen</em> 'Lower Saxony' in the north, and <em>Nordrhein-Westfalen</em> 'North Rhine-Westphalia' (NRW) to the south. At a more local level, public transport in most areas in Germany are organised by transport authorities. This is a map of the German <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Karte_der_Verkehrsverb%C3%BCnde_und_Tarifverb%C3%BCnde_in_Deutschland.png" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbünde</em></a> from German Wikipedia. In areas in Lower Saxony that border the Netherlands, the transport authorities only coordinate the buses, and not the trains (grey areas in the map: <a href="https://www.vej-info.de/" target="_blank">VEJ</a>, <a href="https://www.reise-freunde.de/bve/" target="_blank">bvE</a>, <a href="http://www.vgb-mob.de/" target="_blank">VGB</a>). On the other hand, in North Rhein-Westphalia, the four transport authorities coordinate not only the local trains, but also the U-bahn/trams/buses (yellow areas in the map: <a href="https://www.westfalentarif.de/de/start/" target="_blank">WT</a>, <a href="http://www.vrr.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">VRR</a>, <a href="https://avv.de/de/" target="_blank">AVV</a>, <a href="https://www.vrsinfo.de/" target="_blank">VRS</a>).</p>
	<p>In Lower Saxony, there is the <a href="http://www.niedersachsentarif.de/" target="_blank"><em>Nierdersachsentarif</em></a>, which is a unified fare structure for the local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Breman, and some bordering regions, including Hengelo and Oldenzaal in the Netherlands with German local trains (Eurobahn RB 61). Amongst the <em>Niedersachsentarif</em> tickets is the <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/" target="_blank"><em>Nierdersachsen-Ticket</em></a>, which costs €23/27/31/35/39 for 1/2/3/4/5 people, giving unlimited travel on local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Breman, and some bordering regions for a day. In some areas (none bordering the Netherlands), U-Bahn/trams/buses are also included. The validity maps can be seen in the links above. The validity area of the <em>Nierdersachsen-Ticket</em> is slightly smaller than that of the rest of the <em>Nierdersachsentarif</em> tickets, but both covers RB 61 to Hengelo. Eurobahn provides this map (the 'tariff outline map' in <a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/en/tickets-tariffs/tariff-information/" target="_blank">here</a>) outlining the validity of Dutch, Lower Saxony, and North Rhein-Westphalia tariffs on their lines in this region.</p> 
	<p>There is also the <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/niedersachsen-ticket-plus-groningen/" target="_blank"><em>Nierdersachsen-Ticket plus Groningen</em></a>, which costs €28/33/38/43/48 for 1/2/3/4/5 perople. This has the same validity as the <em>Niedersachsen-Ticket</em>, plus an extension on the Dutch Arriva line between Weener and Groningen.</p>
	<p>An interactive map of the local trains in Lower Saxony is <a href="https://www.lnvg.de/interaktive-karte-streckennetz/" target="_blank">here</a>. (In the map, the red–light grey dotted line linking Norddeich Mole – Leer – Bremen is where local-service rates is valid on long-distance services.)</p>
	<p>In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), there are four local transport authorities: <a href="https://www.westfalentarif.de/de/start/" target="_blank">WT</a>, <a href="http://www.vrr.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">VRR</a>, <a href="https://avv.de/de/startseite" target="_blank">AVV</a>, and <a href="https://www.vrsinfo.de/" target="_blank">VRS</a>, each having unified ticketing for all local trains and U-Bahn/trams/buses in their areas. All the local German trains running directly between NRW and the Netherlands (Enschede, Arnhem Centraal, Venlo, Heerlen) are covered by their tickets, as well as some cross-border buses. (Check carefully with each bus route whether Dutch and/or German ticketing applies on which sections of the route.) Other than the tickets of the transport authorities, there are also the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/hintergrund-nrw-tarif/der-nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick/" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a> tickets, which covers the local trains/U-Bahn/trams/buses in the entire state of NRW, i.e. the four transport authorities. For their <em>PauschalpreisTickets</em> 'flat rate tickets' (time-based tickets that are not trajactory-restricted), they also cover the German local trains from NRW into the Netherlands, as well as some cross-border buses. The best known of these flat-rate NRW tickets are the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-single/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW Single</a> (€30.5 for 1 person for one day), and the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-5-personen/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW 5 Personen</a> (€45 for 5 people for one day). The validity map of the NRW-Tarif for local trains is at the bottom of <a href="http://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumente/01_Tickets_und_Tarife/01_Tickets_im_NRW_Tarif/NRW_Tarif_A-Z/Basismedien_2018/Flyer_NRW_Regionalverkehrsplan_2018.pdf" target="_blank">this brochure</a>: NRW-Tarif is valid on the coloured lines, including the grey lines in Germany and the Netherlands. The solid lines are rail lines where the <em>Tickets zum Verbindungspreis</em> 'trajectory price tickets' are valid. The solid lines plus the dotted lines are where the <em>Tickets zum Pauschalpreis</em> 'flat rate tickets' are valid. The black lines are where NRW-Tarif is not valid, e.g. RB 61 between Hengelo and Rheine, the Belgian local train line from Aachen Hbf.</p>
	<p>For German local trains, German ticket machines give better price than Dutch ticket machines. The following are the distributions of German ticket machines in the Netherlands near the railway frontier points, from north to south (plus some other related comments):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Weener frontier, RB 57: exceptionally, Dutch ticket machines and OV-chipkaart portals extend into Germany, to the stations of Weener and Leer (Ostfriesland).</li>
		<li>Bad Bentheim frontier, IC Amsterdam – Berlin and RB 61: there are NO German ticket machines at Oldenzaal, Hengelo, and the stations along the way to Amsterdam. For the IC service to Germany, you can purchase tickets from the Dutch ticket machines (no discount), or the websites/apps of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a> or <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>. For RB 61 to Germany, there are <a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/en/tickets-tariffs/tariff-information/" target="_blank">ticket machines</a> inside the Eurobahn RB 61 trains. Eurobahn/Keolis Deutschland also <a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/tickets-tarife/tarifinformationen/verkaufsstellen/" target="_blank">says</a> that their tickets can be purchased at the NS ticket office at Hengelo.

<figcaption>The ticket machine inside the Eurobahn train; it asks you to Einstieg wählen 'select entry point', i.e. you have to input the departure station of your ticket first (note that Germany uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTZ#Austria_and_Germany" target="_blank">QWERTZ</a> keyboard layout)</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li>Gronau (Westfalen) frontier, RB 51 and RB 64: there is a DB ticket machine in at least Enschede, which can handle local tickets of <a href="https://www.westfalentarif.de/de/start/" target="_blank">WestfalenTarif</a>, the state-wide <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/hintergrund-nrw-tarif/der-nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick/" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a>, and also long-distance travel in Germany, selling both full-fare and saver-fare tickets (if available). There are also ticket machines inside the trains of <a href="https://www.bahn.de/regional/view/mdb/pv/deutschland_erleben/nrw/westliches_muensterland/2017/mdb_265487_db-tfp-rb51_rz_ansicht.pdf" target="_blank">RB 51</a> and <a href="https://www.bahn.de/regional/view/mdb/pv/deutschland_erleben/nrw/westliches_muensterland/2017/mdb_265489_db-tfp-rb64_rz_ansicht.pdf" target="_blank">RB 64</a>. At Eschede station, the German train platform (platform four B) and DB ticket machine are outside the OV-chipkaart gates; people with a DB-issued ticket for further travels in the Netherlands can ask station staff for a 'KeyCard' with a barcode that opens the gates at Enschede.

		<li>Emmerich frontier, ICE Amsterdam – Frankfurt and RE 19: for the ICE service to Germany, you can purchase tickets from the Dutch ticket machines (no discount), or the websites/apps of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a> or <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>. For RE 19 to Germany, there are Abellio ticket machines at Arnhem Centraal and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4He5vhEf3mH2" target="_blank">Zevenaar</a>. However, these Abellio ticket machines can only handle local tickets of <a href="http://www.vrr.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">VRR-Tarif</a>, and the state-wide <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/hintergrund-nrw-tarif/der-nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick/" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a>. For passengers travelling from Germany to Arnhem Centraal, after the train departs from Zevenaar, Abellio train staff gives out a 'KeyCard' with a bardcode that opens the gates at Arnhem Centraal, for passengers who need one. (Apparently VRR contactless cards can also open the gates at Arnhem Centraal.)

<figcaption>For some long-distance destinations in Germany, you can use an NS ticket machine (or much better still, book online)</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li>Venlo frontier, RE 13: there are DB ticket machines inside <a href="https://goo.gl/images/a2FdFN" target="_blank">Venlo</a> station. Exceptionally, there are <a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/en/tickets-tariffs/tariff-information/" target="_blank">NO ticket machines</a> inside the Eurobahn RE 13 trains.</li>
		<li>Herzogenrath frontier, RE 18. There are DB ticket machines in at least <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TgoEGspjEZD2" target="_blank">Heerlen</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/images/ZUiLTM" target="_blank">Landgraaf</a>, and <a href="https://goo.gl/images/V7SyyU" target="_blank">Eygelshoven Markt</a>. (There was a DB ticket machine at Heerlen de Kissel; but since the German trains no longer stop there, I don't know whether the DB ticket machine is still there or not.) There are <a href="https://avv.de/de/tickets/infos-zum-ticketkauf/am-automat" target="_blank">NO ticket machines</a> inside the DB Regio RE 18 trains.</li>

<h3 id="belgium">Belgian trains and ticketing in the Netherlands</h3>
	      <p>The NS and NMBS/SNCB websites and apps give a fixed-rate discount for non-high-speed train travel between the Netherlands and Belgium, for trips booked seven or more days ahead. The discount is larger for trips on Monday to Thursday. There is no need to book too early ahead: the discounted rate remains the same seven or more days ahead, while the full-flex rate remains the same throughout. (This discount is not available from ticket machines or ticket counters!) One exception is for trips just between Roosendaal and Belgium, or just between Maastricht and Belgium; NMBS/SNCB offers their better fixed-rate price. In general, if you have to go through Roosendaal or Maastricht, see whether travelling domestically to Roosendaal/Maastricht, and then getting a Belgian ticket past the border is a better deal.</p>
	      <p>For Belgian local trains, Belgian ticket machines give better price than Dutch ticket machines. However, the range of tickets on offer is somewhat restricted, in comparison with Belgian ticket machines in Belgium. For instance, the NMBS/SNCB <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/passes-cards/rail-pass.aspx" target="_blank">Rail Pass</a> is not valid in the Netherlands, and it is apparently not sold by the Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands (and definitely not by Dutch Rail). The following are the distributions of Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands near the railway frontier points, from east to west (plus some other related comments):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Visé frontier: there are Belgian ticket machines at Maastricht and Maastricht Randwyck, but apparently not at Eijsden (which is only served by NMBS/SNCB). For travels within the Netherlands, Dutch ticketing applies. For travels just between Maastricht / Maastricht Randwyck / Eijsden and Belgium through the Visé frontier, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht.aspx" target="_blank">Belgian ticketing</a> applies. Belgian tickets to/from Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, or Eijsden have the same price.</li>
		<li>Hazeldonk frontier: there are NO Belgian ticket machines at Breda or further north on the Intercity direct/InterCity routes to Amsterdam/The Hague. Use Dutch ticket machines (no discount), or better still, get e-tickets at least seven days before the departure date through the <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS international</a>, or <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a> websties/apps.</li>
		<li>Roosendaal frontier: there are Belgian ticket machines at <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestand:Belgische_kaartautomaat_in_Roosendaal_I.jpg" target="_blank">Roosendaal</a>. For travels just between Roosendaal and Belgium through the Roosendaal frontier, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/roosendaal.aspx" target="_blank">Belgian ticketing</a> applies.</li>
	</ul>
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180425_162430.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180425_162430.jpg" alt="Maastricht P_20180425_162430.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
	<figcaption>Some ticket machines at Maastricht station; from left to right, NS, Arriva, and in the background, NMBS/SNCB</figcaption></figure>
	      <p>The vast majority of Belgian tickets for the Netherlands have a barcode that can open gates at Dutch stations.</p> 
	      <p>The high-speed trains have their own ticketing; see above. Also read further in the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium page</a>.</p>
	      <h3 id="england">England</h3>
	      <p>NS International (from the website/app at least) provides a <em>Connect Eurostar</em> fare for customers connecting at Brussels to/from Ashford/Ebbsfleet/London: a fixed fare between any stations in the Netherlands and Brussels-Midi/Zuid on non-high-speed rail through any one of the three Dutch-Belgian frontier points: Visé frontier with Belgian local trains from Maastricht, Hazeldonk frontier with Intercity direct/InterCity, or Roosendaal frontier with Belgian local trains from Roosendaal. (The price between the Netherlands and Brussels is fixed, but the Eurostar section between Brussels and England still has dynamic pricing.) High-speed trains between the Netherlands and Brussels are NOT included: Thalys, Eurostar Amsterdam – Rotterdam – Brussels, ICE Liège – Brussels. <a href="#surcharges">Intercity direct supplement</a> is exempt. (I infer from these that ICE Arnhem – Utrecht – Amsterdam is allowed with an ICE supplement, as usual.) From the NS International website/app, just book a ticket between a Dutch station and Ashford/Ebbsfleet/London, and choose an option which satisfies the aforementioned conditions. The resulting e-ticket has a clause which says 'VALID FROM / TO ANY DUTCH STATION (NOT THALYS)' (from e-tickets that I have seen in 2017). Eurostar tickets to/from Ashford, Ebbsfleet, and London cost the same, and Eurostar ticket to/from one has equal validity to/from the other two.</p>

<br/>
	      <p>There are three regular passsenger ferries between the Netherlands and England: <a href="https://www.dfdsseaways.eu/ferry-routes/ferries-from-holland-to-the-uk" target="_blank">Amsterdam IJmuiden – Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, <a href="http://www.stenalinetravel.com/ferry-to-holland" target="_blank">Hoek van Holland – Harwich</a>, <a href="http://www.poferries.com/eu/rotterdam-hull" target="_blank">Rotterdam Europoort – Kingston upon Hull</a>. Amongst these, the Hoek van Holland – Harwich line has a Rail &#38; Sail deal (<a href="https://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry-to-holland/rail-and-sail" targte="_blank">from UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.stenaline.nl/engeland/ferry-en-trein-londen" target="_blank">from NL</a>; the  Netherlands English site does not work properly). This deal includes the ferry journey, plus: a) train travel between Harwich International and any destination in the <a href="https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/" target="_blank">Abellio Great Anglia</a> network, e.g. London Liverpool Street (see also the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/maps.aspx#SouthEast" target="_blank">Southeastern England rail map</a>, and other rail mapss in that page); and/or b) train travel between Hoek van Holland Haven and any destination in the NS network. (Only includes NS, and not the other companies like Arriva. Travelling on ICE or ICd within the Netherlands is allowed with their respective <a href="#surcharges">supplements</a>. The Hoek van Holland line is in the process of being converted into Rotterdam Metro line B; the Rail &#38; Sail deal includes tickets for the replacement bus.) The Rail &#38; Sail deal has to be booked some time ahead for them to send you the tickets.</p>
	      <h3 id="other-public-transport-in-the-netherlands">Other public transport in the Netherlands</h3>
	      <p>Most forms of public transport in the Netherlands are part of a public transport concession. Some concessions include only a few lines, while others cover a large area, including multiple forms of public transport. There are nearly 50 public transport concessions in the Netherlands. Most of these are publically contested. Maps of the coverage of the main non-train concessions can be found <a href="http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/Concessiekaart" target="_blank">here</a>; you can also have a look at my <a href="http://hilario.bambooradical.com/nl/buses_trams_and_metros.html" target="_blank">buses, trams, and metros</a> in NL page.</p> 
	      <p>OV-chipkaart can be used for all domestic travels on trains and metros. The card readers are on the platforms or at another part of a station. Tickets cannot be purchased on board (unless it is a ticket that is sold together with a fine). OV-chipkaart can also be used on all (normal) light rail/trams, the vast majority of buses/trolleybuses, and some ferries. With these, the card readers are located in the vehicles themselves, and passengers have to check in and out of each vehicle. On board these vehicles, paying by cash is either not possible, or are scheduled/projected to become not possible sometime within 2018. Passengers have to either: a) pay with a durable OV-chipkaart; b) show a valid e-ticket; c) show a valid ticket purchased at a ticket machine / ticket counter / authorised shop; or d) pay with electronic means on board a vehicle.</p>
