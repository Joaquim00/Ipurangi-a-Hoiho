<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through the Netherlands. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about the Netherlands in that page are repeated here.</p>  
<h3 id="operators">Passenger train service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger train services in the Netherlands. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>

<br/>
	      <p>Dutch operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
<li>NS <em>Nederlandse Spoorwegen</em> 'Dutch Railways' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The national railway company; runs the majority of trains in the Netherlands.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/special-routes/intercity-direct.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct</a> (ICd) is a semi-high-speed service within the Netherlands. (It runs on high-speed rail, but the trains are not capable of doing 200+km/h. It has fewer stops than InterCity services, but more than high-speed rail services.) For domestic travel, there is a surcharge on the Schiphol – Rotterdam high-speed line (see below). <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-brussels" target="_blank">International ICd</a> is an extension of the domestic ICd service; it is the Amsterdam – Brussels semi-high-speed service run together with NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail).</li>
<li>There are also four InterCity's per day between The Hague (Den Haag Hollands Spoor station) and Brussels, also run together with NMBS/SNCB. This The Hague – Brussels IC, and the Amsterdam – Brussels ICd, are often called the 'Benelux train' (this cross-border service has never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg). For domestic trips within the Netherlands, other than the ICd surcharge, they have normal NS ticketing.</li>
<li>The Amsterdam – Berlin InterCity service is run together with DB (German Rail). Domestic trips within the Netherlands has normal NS ticketing.</li>
<li>NS also runs the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line for <a href="http://www.rnet.nl/" target="_blank">R-net</a>, a brand of the provinces of Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Flevoland, and Utrecht. It follows normal NS ticketing rules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.arriva.nl/" target="_blank">Arriva</a>. Subsidiary of DB. Runs many regional trains in the Netherlands. In the northwest, Dutch Arriva trains and ticketing rules extend into <em>Weener</em> and <em>Leer (Ostfriesland)</em> in Germany. (However, the railway bridge between Weener and Leer collapsed; replacement buses to/from Leer will run for some more years.)</li>
<li><a href="https://blauwnet.nl/" target="_blank">Blauwnet</a>. Brand of the province of Overijssel. Trains run by Arriva (Zwolle – Emmen, Almelo – Hardenberg), or Keolis Nederland (Zwolle – Kampen, Zwolle – Enschede, Zutphen – Oldenzaal). Keolis is majority owned by SNCF (French Rail).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.breng.nl/" target="_blank">Breng</a>. Primarily a bus company, runs additional train services between Arnhem Centraal and Doetinchem, in parallel with Arriva's Arnhem Centraal – Doetinchem – Winterswijk service. Follows Arriva's ticketing rules for this line.</li>
<li><a href="http://valleilijn.nl/" target="_blank">Valleilijn</a>. The Amersfoort – Ede-Wageningen train line is run by <a href="https://www.connexxion.nl/" target="_blank">Connexxion</a>, the parent company of Breng, and ultimately majority owned by the French state.</li>
</ul>
<p>German and Belgian operators with non-high-speed trains running in the Netherlands:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurobahn.de/" target="_blank">Eurobahn/Keolis Deutschland</a>: Hengelo – Bielefeld Hauptbahnhof, Venlo – Hamm (Westfalen). The Hengelo line has two stations in the Netherlands: Hengelo, and Oldenzaal. Domestic travelling within the Netherlands follows Blauwnet/Keolis Nederland ticketing rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bahn.de/regional/view/regionen/nrw/info/ueb_info.shtml" target="_blank">DB Regio NRW</a>: Enschede – Münster (Westfalen) Hauptbahnhof, Enschede – Dortmund Hauptbahnhof, Heerlen – Herzogenrath. The Enschede lines have three stations in the Netherlands: Enschede, Enschede De Eschmarke, Glanerbrug. Domestic travelling on this line in the Netherlands follows Blauwnet/Keolis ticketing rules. In the south, the majority of the Heerlen – Herzogenrath line is in the Netherlands (only Herzogenrath is in Germany). Domestic travelling on this line in the Netherlands follows NS ticketing rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.abellio.de/" target="_blank">Abellio</a>: Arnhem Centraal – Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof. This line has two stations in the Netherlands: Arnhem Centraal and Zevenaar. Domestic travelling in the Netherlands follows Arriva ticketing rules (despite Abellio being an NS subsidiary).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB</a> (Belgian Rail) runs two of its own local train services into the Netherlands: Roosendaal – Antwerpen-Centraal – Puurs, Maastricht – Liège-Guillemins – Hasselt. The Maastricht line has three stations in the Netherlands: Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, Eijsden. Domestic travelling in the Netherlands follows NS ticketing rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>High-speed rail service operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (Amsterdam – Schiphol – Rotterdam – Antwerp – Brussels – Lille/Paris; seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille). It has its own ticketing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (Amsterdam – Rotterdam – Brussels – London). It has its own ticketing. The trip from London is a direct service. The Eurostar trains from the Netherlands stop for over an hour in Brussels, and passengers have to go through border controls at Brussels. (Eurostar usually puts customers from the Netherlands on Thalys services to Brussels.) Direct service from the Netherlands starts at the end of 2019 at the earliest.
<li><a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/ice-international" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (Amsterdam – Utrecht – Arnhem – Oberhausen – Duisburg – Düsseldorf – Cologne – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt/...Basel). ICE International is a consortium between NS and DB. Travelling on the ICE within the Netherlands requires just a normal domestic ticket, plus a ICE surcharge (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="train-types">Train types</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, there are the following train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Sprinter</em> (term primarily used by NS) or <em>Stoptrein</em> (term only used by the other companies): all-stops service; occationally one or two stations are skipped.</li>
	<li><em>Sneltrein</em>: a rarely encountered intermediate category; only operated by Arriva, all run in parallel with <em>Stoptrein</em> services on the same lines. From north to south:
		<ul>
			<li>Leeuwarden – Groningen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden – Emmen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden (peak supplemantary service)</li>
			<li>(Maastricht Randwyck –) Maastricht – Heerlen</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. All domestic InterCity services are operated by NS, except the Raalte – Enschede IC service which is operated by Keolis/Blauwnet. The Amsterdam – Berlin InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and DB. The The Hague – Brussels InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and NMBS/SNCB</li>
	<li><em>Intercity direct</em> (ICd): semi-high-speed service; domestic Amsterdam Centraal – Schiphol Airport – Rotterdam Centraal (– Breda) is operated by NS; International ICd runs further from Breda to Belgium, and is operated jointly by NS and NMBS/SNCB</li>

<p><em>Nachtnet</em> is domestic InterCity services that run between approximately 00:00 till 05:00. Utrecht – Amsterdam – The Hague – Rotterdam are linked every night. During the weekend there are one or two Nachtnet services to some other cities. Many ordinary train services also run till some time past 00:00, or even 01:00; one difference between these ordinary services and Nachtnet services is that the ordinary services could get assisted boarding service till very late, but the Nachtnet services has no assisted boarding service. Nachtnet services have the same ticketing as the other NS services. Tickets are valid for services with a scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, before 04:00 the following day.</p>

<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
<p>There are two main types of tickets: e-ticket, which comes with a barcode, and OV-chipkaart, which is an NFC ticket.</p>
	      <h4 id="e-app-tickets">E-tickets</h4>
	      <p>E-tickets are tickets bought from websites or apps of the public transport providers. For trains:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li> 
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li>
	      </ul>
<p>The NS domestic website sells tickets for all domestic train journeys, including trains that are not run by them. The websites/apps of the other public transport providers also sell products that are spcific to them.</p>	
	<p>E-tickets have a barcode. You have to provide travel details like the 'from' and 'to' stations (the NS websites/apps don't seem to be able to issue a ticket if you add in a 'via' station), date, single/return (for domestic tickets, return is within a day), and class of travel (first vs. second class). Other than travel details, you also have to provide personal details of the traveller, like name and date of birth (the ticket can only be used by the named person). Many e-tickets bought from the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic NS website</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/" target="_blank">NS International website</a> with a destination in Belgium or Germany, can have the E-ticket loaded to their respective apps. Otherwise it has to be printed out on a piece of A4 paper. When using an e-ticket, you have to be able to show an ID if asked.</p>
	<p>E-tickets from the domestic NS website/app gives no discount. With the NS International website/apps, you can specify the subscription cards that you have, and the relevant discount(s) is/are applied. </p>	      
	<p>A good deal that can be purchased from the domestic NS website is the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren" target="_blank">off-peak group ticket</a>.</p>
	      <p>When using an e-ticket, checking in and out at the check-in portals are not required. The barcode can be used to open closed gates at train stations. Some gates have readers that can only read OV-chipkaarts, while other can read both e-ticket barcodes and OV-chipkaarts. There is always at least one gate that can read e-ticket barcodes.</p>
	      <h4 id="ov-chipkaart">OV-chipkaart</h4>
<p>OV-chipkaarts are near-field communication (NFC) cards; you place these tickets near the reader (within centimetres), and it is read/validated. There are disposable OV-chipkaarts, and durable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<h5>Disposable OV-chipkaarts, and Dutch Rail ticket machines/ticket counters</h5>
<p>Disposable OV-chipkaarts are short-term tickets issued by train-ticket machines. All domestic tickets and many international tickets issued at ticket counters are also disposable OV-chipkaarts. <a href="https://www.ret.nl/en.html" target="_blank">Rotterdam</a> and <a href="https://en.gvb.nl/" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> also issue their short-term public transport tickets in the form of disposable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<p>NS has <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">three types of ticket machines</a>. The usual ticket machines have a blue sign with the NS logo. These give disposable OV-chipkaart tickets. (Machines with a yellow sign with the word <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em>, and narrow machines which says <em>saldo opladen</em>, are for people who already possess a durable OV-chipkaart).</p>
<p>NS ticket machines and the normal ticket counters sell the same range of single/return tickets, and charge the same fees. For domestic single/return tickets, the issuing cost of a disposable OV-chipkaart is €1, which is added to the normal ticket price. This €1 fee does not apply to, e.g., <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> (children's ticket), <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-fiets" target="_blank">bicycle ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-hond" target="_blank">dog ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/alleen-te-koop-via-station-of-kaartautomaat/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a> (for the NL/BE/DE tripoint region), and international tickets that Dutch ticket machines/normal ticket counters can handle. The Dutch ticket machines and the normal ticket counters can handle many destinations in Belgium and Luxembourg, and some closer or larger destinations in Germany (see <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/destinations-purchasable-at-ticket-machines" target="_blank">here</a> for the list of possible destinations). They can handle a very limited range of ICE tickets to Germany (they cannot reserve seats), but they cannot handle Thalys or Eurostar tickets to Belgium or further.</p> 
	<p>Other than the normal NS ticket counters, there are seven <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/tickets-services/opening-hours-ticket-and-service-shops" target="_blank">NS International ticket offices</a> where you can purchase the full range of international tickets that NS International can offer. However, for international tickets that the NS ticket machines cannot handle, the NS International offices charge a <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/stations-service-offices" target="_blank">service fee</a> of €7.5 per person, to a maximum of €22.50 per booking. (It is best to purchase tickets online in general.) Most NS International ticket offices also have self-service computers where you can make your own booking online, and print the ticket(s) out.</p>
	<p>With an NS ticket machine, you can switch between Dutch and English language. The main screen has three main options: single tickets, return tickets, and other tickets. When purchasing a domestic single/return ticket:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the 'from' station is by default the station where the machine is located, but you can also change the 'from' station by pressing the 'from' button.</li>
		<li>the most popular 'to' destinations are displayed. If your intended destination is not on the list, you have to key in the first one or two letters of the name of the destination station, and then a list of stations that begin with those letter(s) will appear. Press the button with the name of your inteded destination. Some destinations are not train stations; they combine <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/overige-kaartjes/p/trein-tram-bus-enkel" target="_blank">train and tram/bus travel</a>. For instance, if you look for destinations that begin with 'E', there are 'Efteling' (theme park) and 'Eindhoven Airport' which are not names of railway stations. Tickets to these include train and bus travel.</li>
		<li>choose date, and class of travel (first or second class). For domestic return tickets, the return journey has to be made within the day. A ticket is valid for trains of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is before 04:00 the following day. If you want to travel after that, you have to a separate ticket.
		<li>pay. Ticket machines DO NOT take banknotes. Some machines take coins. All machines take bankcards and credit cards (V PAY, Maestro, Visa, Mastercard; €0.5 surcharge for credit card). When using cards, the flow of procedures is: insert card, wait, withdraw card (when it tells you to), input PIN code, press OK. Then the ticket comes out if the transaction is successful. (Dutch Rail had been quite reluctant in accepting credit cards, but now credit cards are accepted at all ticket machines and online.)</li>
	      </ul>		
	<p>To purchase an international ticket, the option for purchasing international tickets is embedded within the 'other tickets' option at the initial screen. (Alternatively, if you have pressed the single/return ticket option at the initial screen, you will only discover, after many steps, that these options are only for domestic tickets. A small button for purchasing international tickets will eventually appear in the corner.) </p>
	<p>With Dutch ticket machines, other than a 'from' and 'to' station, you can also specify a 'via' station. (You can break a journey between the 'from' and 'to' station; you only need to specify a 'via' station if it involves a detour.) If your journey involves options between trains of different companies, usually it will ask you which option you want to take. (If not, you will have to specify a 'via' station to clarify the route you want to take.) With some international trips, you have the option of specifying which border point you will cross.</p>
<p>Ticket machines no longer give discounted tickets. To benefit from samenreiskorting (see <a href="#samenreiskorting">below</a>), one needs to have a durable OV-chipkaart.</p>
<h5>Durable OV-chipkaart</h5>
<p>Durable OV-chipkaarts are valid for five years. There are anonymous OV-chipkaarts and personal OV-chipkaarts. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts can be used by anyone, and the normal retail price is €7.5. (This is just the retail price, not a deposit!) Each OV-chipkaart can only be used by one person at a time; children 4 years old or above need their own ticket/OV-chipkaart. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts are sold at ticket machines, ticket counters, and at some shops (search for OV-chipkaart sales points <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Personal OV-chipkaarts is for one particular person, whose details and photo are printed on the card. A personal OV-chipkaart also cost €7.5, but it is given out for free in some cases, e.g., when you order certain <em>annual</em> <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS subscriptions</a>. Otherwise, for people with an address in Benelux or Germany, one can ask for a personal OV-chipkaart from the <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart website</a>. (For people living elsewhere, <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/everything-about-travelling/different-types-of-passenger/tourists.htm" target="_blank">it is complicated</a>, and more expensive.)</p>
	      <p>Credit (i.e. money) can be added to a durable OV-chipkaart through ticket machines of NS, other Dutch railway companies, and many other public transport providers. NS has <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">ticket machines</a> which are just for people with durable OV-chipkaarts (ones which says <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em> or <em>saldo opladen</em>), and these do not sell single/return tickets. There are also many free-standing OV-chipkaart terminals (they are yellow in colour) where one can add credit to an OV-chipkaart with a bankcard. One can also add credit, or purchase subscriptions from public transport providers, online. However, afterwards you still need to go to a ticket machine, or one of the many dedicated OV-chipkaart terminals (some of which are in buses/trams), to load the product purchased online into the OV-chipkaart. <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find OV-chipkaart service points. There are machines that can deal of OV-chipkaarts throughout European Netherlands, and the Arriva stations in Weener and Leer in Germany.</p>
	      <p>(On the other hand, asking for a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/applying-for-a-credit-refund.htm" target="_blank">refund</a> from an OV-chipkaart is not straightforward.)</p>
	      <p>Children 4 to 11 years can load a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket (€2.5) to their OV-chipkaart. For people with an NS subscription, they can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/kids-vrij.html" target="_blank">Kind Vrij</a> subscriptions for a child (at most three children), costing €0.01 a year. The only extra cost is €7.5 if they need to purchase an OV-chipkaart. So children can travel on trains basically for free for a whole year! (With other public transport, children need to have credit in their OV-chipkaart, and an age-based discount is automatically applied.) Older people usually travel by having credit in their durable OV-chipkaart. Credit is automatically deducted as one checks the card in and out during one's journey.</p>
<p>As one begins a journey, a deposit is charged to the card when one checks in at a check-in portal. The deposit is anywhere between €0 to €20, depending on the public transport company, type of OV-chipkaart, type of subscription that one has, etc. (Without an NS subscription, the deposit for catching NS trains is €20.) One can only successfully check in if, after the deposit, the credit in the OV-chipkaart is not under negative €4. When a journey ends, a refund is given if the fare is lower than the deposit, or extra credit is charged if the fare is higher than the deposit.</p>
	      <p>With a durable OV-chipkaart, checking out and then back in again at the same station within 35 minutes is consider a transfer. (One long journey, including transfers, is cheaper than the same route covered by consecutive shorter journeys). To cancel a check-in, the deposit is refunded if one checks out again at the same station within 60 minutes. However, with NS, one cannot check out within 100 seconds of checking-in; this is to prevent people from double-tapping the card, accidentally checking out after they have checked in. (You can also use this method to check whether you have already checked in. Another method is to check your travel history at a ticket machine.)</p>
<p>If you have forgotten to check in, try to check in before you step into a train. (In places with open gates, remember to check in on the 'check-in side', i.e. the side that is outside the paid area.) If you are already inside a train, contact the conductor. If not, you risk a fine. If you have forgotten to check out, you can go back to the station where you ended your journey and check out there within six hours of the last check-in. If not, go to a service counter of the public transport provider and ask for help. Failing that, try contacting <a href="https://www.uitcheckgemist.nl/?locale=en" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart</a>.</p>
<p>One can check the credit in a card, or the travel history of the card, at ticket machines. Or at the OV-chipkaart website/app if the card is linked to an account registered with the OV-chipkaart website/app.</p>
	      <p><em>Abonnementen</em> and 'peak time': <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS</a> and other public transport providers have various subscriptions that give discounted or unlimited travel of some sort. When peak/non-peak is referred to, <em>non-peak</em> is most usually 18:30–06:30 and 09:00–16:00 on weekdays, and the whole day on weekend and holidays. On non-holiday weekdays: a) you can check in with non-peak rates a few (five?) minutes before 09:00 and 18:30 on weekdays; b) the non-peak rate is valid as long as the scheduled departure time of the train that you catch, at the station where you board the train, is before 06:30 or 16:00.</p>
	      <p id="samenreiskorting"><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/combined-travel-discount.html" target="_blank"><em>Samenreiskorting</em></a>: people with NS subscriptions (except Kids Vrij) can take three other travellers along with them, and they enjoy 40% discount during off-peak. These co-travellers need to activate the <em>samenresikorting</em> option in their own OV-chipkaart beforehand, through a ticket machine.</p>
	      <h5>Other forms of NFC tickets</h5>
	      <p>The trial for <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ovchipmobiel.htm" target="_blank">OV-chip mobiel</a> (OV-chipkaart system with NFC-enabled smart phones) ends at 15 June 2018. (I don't know what plans they have for this mode of payment.)</p>
	      <p>As far as I know, there is nowhere in the Netherlands where you can use a contactless bankcard/creditcard to check in and out with public transport. (Many buses and trams are cash-less, while others are aiming to become cash-less in 2018. Many buses/trams have bankcard/creditcard payment terminals.)</p>
	      <h4 id="promotional-tickets-and-tourist-tickets">Promotional tickets and 'tourist tickets'</h4>
	      <p>NS runs various promotional tickets (but you'll need Dutch reading skills). Some are sold through its own <a href="https://www.spoordeelwinkel.nl/" target="_blank">online store</a>, while others are sold in coorporation and through other physical or online stores. One place where these various deals are summarised is <a href="https://www.treinreiziger.nl/category/treinkaartjes/" target="_blank">treinreiziger.nl</a>. Ones that are sold at physical stores can be disposable OV-chipkaarts, or a code which you turn into an e-ticket on the internet (they come with instructions, in Dutch).</p>
	      <p>NS sells the following 'tourist tickets':</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/amsterdam-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam Travel Ticket</a>: €16/€21/€26 for 1/2/3 days. One return journey (?) on the train between Schiphol Airport and {the Amsterdam– stations, or Duivendrecht}, and unlimited travel on GVB trams/buses/metros/ferries, and the airport express bus 397 or N97.

	      </ul>
	      <h4 id="check-in-portals">Check-in portals</h4>
<p>If you hold an e-ticket, this section does not concern you; you do not need to check in or out. The barcode in your e-ticket (on a piece of paper, or in a mobile app) can be used to open closed gates at stations.</p>
	<p>For holders of OV-chipkaarts: there are two types of check-in portals: poles and gates. The check-in poles are just standing structures where you tap your card for checking in or out. On the other hand, check-in gates have barriers which, if closed, restrict access to the platforms, and only open as one checks in or out with with an OV-chipkaart. (Some stations have gates that are not closed, for at least part of the day. You still need to check in or out at these open gates.) Whether stations have gates or not is not relative to the size of a station; some very small stations have gates, while some large stations do not have gates.</p>
<p>There are four system of check-in portals: NS, Arriva, Blauwnet, and Valleilijn. When catching trains of these four companies/brands, use the corresponding check-in portals. For companies other than these four, use the non-NS ones that are present, except for these three that use NS portals: a) in the west, R-net Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn (which is run by NS), b) in the deep south, NMBS/SNCB Maastricht – Eijsden, and c) in the deep south, DB Regio Heerlen – Eygelshoven Markt. (Information in 2018; c, and perhaps b, will change in 2019.) This information is displayed in some of the maps, two of them repeated here:</p>

<br/>
<p>There are not many stations where two systems intersect; the vast majority of them are in the east of the country. There is only one station, Zutphen, where three systems intersect. You do not need to check out and then in again if you are changing trains of the same system. If you change between two systems, there are check-in poles of each system standing next to each other on the platforms; you check out of one system, and then in with the other system.</p> 
<p>There are some stations where metro and trains share the same paid area, or even either sides of an island platform; you can find their respective check-in poles standing next to each other.</p> 
<p>All metro stations have ticket gates, accessible with an OV-chipkaart (with enough credit or a relavant travel product). On the other hand, with buses/trams/waterbuses, their card readers are inside the vehicle; you have to check in and out of each individual bus/tram/waterbus that you board.</p>      
	      <h3 id="other-matters">Other matters</h3>
<h4 id="breaking-and-detour">Breaking and detours</h4>
<p>Except for non-flexible high-speed-rail tickets, breaking of journey is allowed. Feel free to stop at an intermediate point. The ticket is valid for services (on the designated route) of which the scheduled departure time (at the station where you board the train) is earlier than 04:00 the following day.</p>
<p>NS and the Leeuwarden/Groningen lines of Arriva charge fares are based on 'tariff units' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1522750534329/content/assets/ns-nl/voorwaarden-folders/2018/tariefeenheden-vz-2018-update-april.pdf" target="_blank">map (April 2018)</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/consumer-rates.html" target="_blank">rates</a>). Each unit is roughly 1km in distance, but some sections charge higher tariff units than actual distance. 0-8 units cost the same, and the price increases with each unit unitl 200 units. Journeys longer than 200 units are charged 200 units. Other companies/lines have tariffs based on the actual distance in km. (If one begins a journey with NS, and ends with another company, the return journey along the same route can have a different price, due to the difference in tariff rules. The rules of the company at the beginning of the journey has some precedence.)</p>
<p>If the ticket does not specify the exact route/which company's trains you must take, you are meant to take the shortest route between the 'from' station and the 'to' station. Near two opposite ends of a railway loop, the tariff units are often configured so that it cost the same to travel through either side of the loop, despite slight difference in actual distance. For instance, a ticket which says from Amsterdam Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal, without further qualifications, allows the traveller to travel on the faster InterCity via Den Haag HS (the western route), or the slower Sprinter via Breukelen (the eastern route), despite the two routes not having exactly the same length. Both are charged 86 units (second class full fare €15.4). The new Intercity direct (ICd) travels on an even shorter / more direct route, but it also charges 86 units (plus an ICd supplement of €2.4 for the high-speed line between Schiphol and Rotterdam). Check route suggestions and price information given by the NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/ target="_blank">website</a>/app.</p>
<p>When there are track works, or accidents, which affect the journey stated in your ticket, you can use your ticket as usual, and take the detour recommended by the railway companies. Train conductors have hand-held devices which have real time information on track works and accidents.</p>
