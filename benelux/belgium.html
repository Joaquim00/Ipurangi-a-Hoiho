	      <p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Belgium (Dutch: <em>België</em>, French: <em>Belgique</em>, German: <em>Belgien</em>, Luxembourgish: <em>Belsch</em>). See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about Belgium in that page are repeated here.</p>  
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Belgium. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Belgium (plus the Netherlands and Luxembourg).</p>

	      <figcaption>Train operators and their networks in Benelux</figcaption></figure></div>
<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (Dutch: <em>Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen</em>, French: <em>Société nationale des chemins de fer belges</em> 'National Company of the Belgian Railways'; <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The Belgian national railway company; runs all but a few trains in Belgium. NMBS/SNCB's own network is extended into all neighbouring countries: a little into the Netherlands, Germany, France, and all the way into Luxembourg City from two different directions.
	<ul>
		<li>The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity is run together with NS (Dutch Rail; <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). These trains run on the Antwerp – Rotterdam high-speed rail line, and for the vast majority of Amsterdam services, also on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line. The ones that go through the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) in the Netherlands. This Brussels–Amsterdam/The Hague service is commonly called the 'Benelux train'. (Despite the name, it has never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg.) This is a semi-high-speed service: the trains run on high-speed rail lines, some sections of which are not serviced by non-high-speed train types, but they are not capable of doing 200+ km/h.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The Luxembourgish national railway company. Near the Belgian–Luxembourgish border, CFL runs trains every half or one hour everyday to Athus. (Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is also extended to Athus with CFL trains and Luxembourgish buses.) On weekdays, CFL runs a few peak services to Virton and Gouvy.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators: <br/>(Unless otherwise indicated, at Brussels-Midi/Zuid ('Brussels-South') they depart from platforms 3/4/5/6, where there is occasional security control, but no border control)</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (Brussels-South – Brussels-North – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne (– Cologne/Bonn Airport) – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt). ICE International is a consortium between DB (German Rail) and NS (Dutch Rail). International and domesitc travel within Germany follow German long-distance ticketing rules (e.g. dynamic pricing). If travelling domestically within Belgium (Brussels – Liège), there is an ICE surcharge (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail) (Brussels-South to Lille-Europe and many other destinations in France like Paris CDG Airport, but not the main Paris stations). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (Paris-Nord/Lille-Europe – Brussels-South – Antwerp-Central – Rotterdam – Schiphol – Amsterdam; Paris-Nord – Brussels-South – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne – Düsseldorf (– Düsseldorf Airport) – Duisburg – Essen (– Dortmund); seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille). The first and second shareholders are SNCF and NMBS/SNCB respectively. It has its own ticketing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a>. Low-cost service between Brussels-South and Paris-Nord by Thalys. Runs half on high-speed rail, and half on conventional rail. It has its own fare structure, and tickets can only be booked through the IZY website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (London (–Ebbsfleet) (–Ashford) (–Calais) – Lille – Brussels-South; London – Brussels-South – Rotterdam – Amsterdam). Majority owned by SNCF. It has its own ticketing. Eurostar services to the Netherlands depart from platforms 3/4/5/6. Eurostar services to France and England depart from platforms 1/2: passengers to UK depart from the main Eurostar check-in area with full border and security checks, while passengers to France (Lille/Calais) go through a separate check-in terminal without border checks. (The carriage for passengers to France is tightly segregated from the carriages for UK.) Eurostar tickets from Brussels to France can only be booked through the Belgian Eurostar website, at least 2 days (?) before departure. Eurostar tickets to/from the the three stations in England cost the same; a Eurostar ticket booked from one of the three stations <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/be-en/question/I-ve-booked-from-one-station-can-I-board-at-another" target="_blank">allows you to board at the other two stations</a>. Similarly, Eurostar passengers from Continental Europe can disembark at any of the three stations in England. (But not all trains stop at Ebbsfleet or Ashford.)</li>  
	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Very close to the Belgian border (less than 2.5 km) is the French station of Tourcoing (on the Kortrijk – Mouscron – Lille-Flandres InterCity line), a terminus for OUIGO. Two OUIGO stations that are easily accessible from southeastern Belgium are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV south of Luxembourg.</p>
	      <h3 id="train-types">Train types</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, trains in Belgium can be divided into high-speed and non-high-speed trains. The high-speed services are already introduced above; here are one-line summaries of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): high-speed service between Brussels and Frankfurt</li>
		<li><em>TGV</em>: high-speed services between Brussels and various destinations in France</li>
		<li><em>Thalys</em>: high-speed service to Paris/Lille, Essen/Dortmund, and Amsterdam</li>
		<li><em>IZY</em>: low-cost high-speed service between Brussels and Paris</li>
		<li><em>Eurostar</em>: high-speed service to Lille/London, and Amsterdam</li>
	</ul>
<p>As for non-high-speed services, they can be devided into regular services, and supplementary services. Regular services run every half or one or two hours. There are the following regular non-high-speed train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/s-train.aspx" target="_blank">S train</a> (Dutch: <em>S-trein</em> / <em>voorstadstrein</em>; French: <em>Train S</em> / <em>train suburbain</em>; German: <em>S-Zug</em> / <em>S-Bahn</em>): basically all-stops service in Greater Brussels; some S train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services). Each S train line has a line number: on weekdays there are S1 to S10, S20, and peak service S81; on weekends there are S1, S2, S5, S6, S8, S10, S20.</li>
	<li>L train (Dutch: <em>L-trein</em> / <em>stoptrein</em>; French <em>Train L</em> / <em>omnibus</em>; German: <em>L-Zug</em> / <em>Nahverkehrszug</em>): basically all-stops service elsewhere in the country, including the lines to Roosendaal and Maastricht in the Netherlands, and Aachen Hbf in Germany. Some L train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services).</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): basically only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. During the weekend, IC trains may make extra stops at some sections. The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity service is jointly operated by NMBS/SNCB and NS (Dutch Rail). (In the Netherlands, the vast majority of the Brussels – Amsterdam services run on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line, and these are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) by NS.) </li>
</ul>
<p>There used to be an intermediate category called the InterRegio (IR), but this category no longer exists in Belgium.</p>
<p>The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Belgium. If you are not familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium" target="_blank">language areas in Belgium</a>: in the Dutch-speaking north, usually only the Dutch version of place names are shown on signs; in the French-speaking south, usually only the French version of place names are shown on signs. Brussels is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, and there is also a small German-speaking area in far eastern Belgium. Place names in different languages can look (and sound) rather different. For instance, Liège is <em>Liège</em> in French, <em>Luik</em> in Dutch, and <em>Lüttich</em> in German. Belgian trains often cross these official language boundaries multiple times in one journey, and change the language used in announcements accordingly. In the following maps, names of stations in multiple languages are given.</p>

<br/>
	      <p>Other than the regular trains, there are also the supplementary trains. These are irregular train services that run in addition to the regular (non-high-speed) train services listed above. They often have routing and stopping patterns that are different from the regular services.</p>
<ul>
	<li>P trains (Dutch: <em>P-trein</em> / <em>piekuurtrein</em>; French: <em>Train P</em> / <em>train d'heure de pointe</em>; German <em>P-Zug</em> / <em>Zug des Spitzenverkehrs</em>). Some are all-stops, some are like InterCity's, and many are somewhat mixed. Most P trains run on weekdays during peak hours, usually in the dominant commute direction, primarily during non-holiday periods. There are also the Sunday P trains, which are aimed at sending students back to their tertiary institution on Sunday evenings during term time.</li>
	<li>ICT trains (Dutch: <em>ICT-trein</em> / <em>toeristentrein</em>; French <em>Trein ICT</em> / <em>train touristique</em>). These are additional trains to and from popular holiday destinations, especially the coast and Walibi (theme park). Some are run on weekdays, more are run on the weekend. NMBS/SNCB can run extra ICT services to the coast if the weather is predicted to be remarkably good. The ICT services are primarily run during the holiday periods, so they are largely mutually exclusive with the P services, which are primarily run during the non-holiday periods.</li>
	      </ul>
<p>The following are network maps of the supplementary passenger rail services in Belgium. Included in the weekday P train map are S trains (i.e. they have S train line numbers) that are functionally P trains.</p>

<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	<p>Mirroring the complexity of the Belgian railway network, there is a myriad of ticketing options in Belgium. Here I will only introduce the most-commonly encountered ticketing issues.</p>
	      <h4 id="channels-of-purchase">Channels of purchase</h4> 
	      <h5>International tickets</h4>
	      <p>The user interface of NMBS/SNCB International's <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a> and  app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>) are basically the same. Other than inputting the 'from' and 'to' stations, you can also input a 'via' station. If it can compute your route, it gives you a list of possible routes. You choose one of them, it shows you the details of the journey, and ticket conditions. You press 'book' for the journey that you want to book. You then input your personal details. The payment methods are Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, PayPal, Bancontact (Belgian debit card), and iDEAL (Dutch bank transfer). If payment is successful, a ticket is issued. For most destinations, an e-ticket is delivered. See <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Delivery" target="_blank">ticket delivery methods</a>.</p>
	      <p>Some ticket offices/counters can handle international tickets. In 20+ stations, they offer the full range of international tickets offered by NMBS/SNCB International. In another 20+ stations, they can handle tickets to destination(s) directly reachable from there (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of such stations). Other than purchasing tickets at a ticket counter, tickets can also be purchased via telephone. For ticket purchase at a ticket counter or via telephone, in many cases they charge a service fee of €5/€9/€14 (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">here</a>). Tickets purchased via telephone, or tickets purchased online that cannot be delivered as an e-ticket, can be picked up for free at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#PickupStations" target="_blank">48 Belgian stations and 6 Dutch stations</a>. (For tickets that can be issued as an e-ticket, but you choose to pick it up at a station, there is a handling fee of €6.)</p>
	      <p>The range of international tickets that Belgian ticket machines can handle is very small, and all of them are 'just across the border'. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a>.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic tickets via the NMBS/SNCB app</h5>
<p>At the NMBS/SNCB domestic app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), you start by using the journey planner. If you press a suggested journey that is purely domestic, and involves only trains, at the bottom of the suggestion is a button which says 'buy ticket'. Check the details of the ticket: Product (i.e. <a href="#types-of-tickets">ticket type</a>), From, To, Number of passengers (1 to 6), Date, Type/Class (single/return/1st class/2nd class). 'Via' is not possible with Belgian domestic tickets; breaking of journey is allowed, but if you make a detour, you have to buy two separate tickets (see <a href="#breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">below</a>). Pressing tick on the top right corner gets you to a confirmation screen; price is also given on the same screen. Press tick again, and you'll have to input the personal details of the principle traveller: first name, last name, date of birth, and e-mail address. Methods of payment are Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Only credit cards are accepted. When the transaction is succesful, the ticket is stored in the app. You have to show the mobile ticket from the app in a smart phone, or tablet computer, when asked by a train conductor. The principle traveller also has to be ready to show their ID; the personal details of the principle traveller in the ticket has to match that in their ID.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets via the NMBS/SNCB website</h5>
	      <p>At the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB domestic website</a>, you can start by using the journey planner. After it gives you suggested itinieraries, there is a 'buy ticket' button at the bottom. (Alternatively, press <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> directly to their ticketing page. Or try their <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new ticketing page</a>.) You then have to fill in the journey details and the personal details of the traveller. In contrast to the app, which is only for domestic journeys, the website can also handle tickets on NMBS/SNCB trains to Aachen, Roosendaal, and Maastricht. (Maastricht Randwyck and Eijsden cost the same as Maastricht.) In the <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">ticketing page</a>, in the 'Ticket' drop-down list, select 'TICKET AACHEN', 'TICKET ROOSENDAAL', or 'TICKET MAASTRICHT' instead of the usual options like 'STANDARD TICKET'. (On the other hand, with the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new ticketing page</a>, you can just input Aachen, Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, or Eijsden as the origin/destination.) The range of payment accepted are:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Card: Mastercard, Bancontact, BNP Paribas Fortis, American Express, Visa</li>
		      <li>Belgian bank transfer: ING, Belfius, KBC, CBC</li>
	      </ul>
<p>After a successful transaction, an e-ticket is delivered as a pdf, which you have to print out. Alternatively, for a purely domestic journey, Belgians can choose to have the e-ticket recorded electronically in their Belgian national ID card; you input the ID card number before payment.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets via Belgian ticket machines and ticket counters</h5>
	      <p>There are ticket machines at all Belgian stations. In the Netherlands and Germany, there are Belgian ticket machines at Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Aachen Hauptbahnhof (but apparently not in Eijsden). You can choose from English, German, French, or Dutch language at the ticket machines. They take Visa, Bancontact (Belgian cards), MasterCard, Maestro, and American Express. Some also take coins.</p>
	      </p>They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., internet-only tickets). The range of international tickets that they sell is very limited: tickets to Aachen Hbf, Roosendaal, or Maastricht on NMBS/SNCB trains can be bought from any ticket machines in Belgium; tickets for Lille on NMBS/SNCB trains, and 'anywhere in Luxembourg' tickets, can only be bought in their respective border regions. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a> on the conditions of these tickets. The Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands and Germany have a somewhat restricted range of tickets on offer. For instance, the NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, which is not valid outside Belgium, is apparently not sold there.</p>	      
	  <p>Some stations have ticket counters. They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., internet-only tickets). The ticket counters at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">these stations</a> can sell international tickets. They may charge a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">ticket-issuing fee</a> for international tickets.</p>
	      <h5>Tickets purchased from NMBS/SNCB train conductors, and fines</h5>
	      <p>Buying tickets on board NMBS/SNCB trains incurs a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">fee of €7</a>, unless:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>you buy your ticket onboard an NMBS/SNCB train while it is not in Belgium. (Not including the Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague IC; if you travel in a train without a valid ticket in the Netherlands, you will probably get a fine of €50.)</li>
		      <li>you buy a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">diabolo fee</a> (Brussels Airport-Zaventem station access fee; €5.3).</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>Go to a train conductor before they come to you. If you fail to buy a ticket on board, you will get a fine of €75 in Belgium. (I don't know what rules apply if you're in an NMBS/SNCB train in a neighbouring country. For instance, the usual Luxembourgish fine is €150.)</p>
	      <p>The ticket that you get from a train conductor is an <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/ticket-on-the-train.aspx" target="_blank">RFID ticket</a> (contactless). If you need a receipt, or need to read the data of an RFID ticket issued to you, you can tap that ticket on the card reader at a Belgian ticket machine. An RFID ticket cannot be used to travel from Belgium to a neighbouring country.</p>
	      <h4 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets: domestic and cross-border</h4>
	      <p>There is a plethora of ticket types sold by NMBS/SNCB for domestic and short-distance cross-border journeys. (Things are complicated, but it is because there are many good deals.) Here I will only introduce some common ones for domestic trips.</p>

	      <li>There is a range of tickets to <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/aachen.aspx" target="_blank">Aachen Hbf</a> in Germany, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/roosendaal.aspx" target="_blank">Roosendaal</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht.aspx" target="_blank">Maastricht</a> in the Netherlands (Maastricht Randwyck and Eijsden cost the same as Maastricht). Ticket machines in Belgium and the NMBS/SNCB website can handle tickets to/from these stations. (But not the NMBS/SNCB app!) There are also Belgian ticket machines at these stations in Germany and the Netherlands (apparently except Eijsden). However the range of tickets available in these ticket machines is somewhat smaller (e.g. the Rail Pass is apparently not available). In the <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a>, you need to choose from the 'Ticket' drop-down list the option of TICKETS AACHEN, TICKETS ROOSENDAAL, or TICKETS MAASTRICHT, and not the usual options like STANDARD TICKET. In the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a>, you just need to input Aachen, Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, or Eijsden as the 'from' or 'to' station. (It is apparently not possible to book tickets between these.) The domestic <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/groups/pet-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Pet Ticket</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bike.aspx" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> are also valid on these NMBS/SNCB services. A ticket from the border to Aachen/Roosendaal/Maastricht can be used back-to-back with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train. For instance, you can use a Rail Pass up till Hergenrath near the German border, and then present another ticket between Hergenrath and Aachen Hbf, while sitting in the same Belgian train.

	<h4 id="bicycles-and-pets">Bicycles and pets</h4>
<p>Folded up folding bicycles travel for free. Otherwise, for domestic travel and for Roosendaal/Maastricht/Aachen Hbf on NMBS/SNCB trains, a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bike.aspx" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> (Fietsbiljet/Billet Vélo/Fahrradfahrkarte) is €5 for one-way, and €8 for a day ticket (dagkaart/carte 1 jour/Tageskarte). A bicycle ticket is not valid, i.e. bicycles are not allowed to board/deboard trains, at Brussels-Central, Brussels-Chapelle/-Kapellekerk, and Brussels-Congres. Bicycles are also not allowed on the Libramont – Bastogne NMBS/SNCB bus. See the domestic <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/stations-and-train/bike-on-the-train.aspx" target="_blank">bike on train</a> page, and the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Preparation#Bicycles" target="_blank">international FAQ</a>. (Ignore what the international page say about Aachen; when you buy a bicycle ticket for Aachen at Belgian Rail ticket machines or <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">website</a>, the domestic bicycle ticket is offered. But do check again.) NMBS/SNCB charges €13 for bicycle carriage on international non-high-speed trains, including those to Lille and Luxembourg. (On the other hand, for Luxembourg, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/loisir-et-tourisme/randonneurs-et-cyclistes" target="_blank">bicycles travel for free</a> in CFL trains and buses.)</p>

	<h4>Summary of purchase channels and ticket types</h4>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB provides this <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/where-to-buy-my-tickets/buy-summary.aspx" target="_blank">summary table</a> for the various channels of purchase and types of tickets.</p>
<h4 id="international-ticketing">International ticketing</h4>
	  <p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone.</p>
	  <h5>Germany</h5>
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Aachen Hbf, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>. The German local-tariff tickets of the Aachen area, namely the normal tickets of AVV, and the NRW-Tarif, are NOT valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf. (Nonetheless, they are valid on some cross-border buses.) Bordering Belgium, from north to south, are the <a href="https://avv.de/de/startseite" target="_blank">AVV</a> (Aachen) and <a href="https://www.vrsinfo.de/" target="_blank">VRS</a> (e.g. Cologne/Bonn) public transport regions in the state of North Rhein-Westphalia, and the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/" target="_blank">VRT</a> (Trier) public transport region in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. See the <a href="netherlands.html#germany">Netherlands page</a> for North Rhein-Westphalia, and the <a href="luxembourg.html#germany">Luxembourg page</a> for Rhineland-Palatinate.</p>
	  <p>There is the <em>Euregio ticket</em>, which IS valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf, plus many other non-high-speed rail services and buses/trams in the wider Belgium/Netherlands/Germany tripoint region. See <a href="netherlands.html#euregio">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>For ICE tickets between Belgium and Germany, with <em>Sparpreis Europa</em> saver fares, the price is the same to/from any Belgian train stations. Just input the actual origin and destination stations when booking an ICE ticket. See the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ICE_ABS" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International. (What NMBS/SNCB International says is actually not true: NMBS/SNCB is quite generous with the Sparpreis free distance that it gives from the ICE stations in Brussels and Liège, but for the western and southern extremities of Belgium, the Sparpreis can be bumped up by €10 or €20. If you are concerned about budget, it is best to compare the price for Brussels/Liège, and then find out at what point from Brussels/Liège the price is bumped up. The distance is not the same for all trains.)</p>  
	  <h5>The Netherlands</h5>	
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Roosendaal or Maastricht, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>.</p>
	  <p>There is also the <em>Euregio ticket</em>, which is valid on many non-high-speed rail services and buses/trams in the Belgium/Netherlands/Germany tripoint region. See <a href="netherlands.html#euregio">here</a>.</p>
<p>For non-high-speed train tickets between Belgium and the Netherlands, there is an <em>online-only</em> discount (i.e. no discount from ticket machines/ticket counters!): a fixed discount is given (i.e. no need to book too early) if booked seven or more days ahead from the NMBS/SNCB or NS international websites or apps. The discount is on average 40&#37; off full-flex for trips on Monday to Thursday, and 20&#37; off for trips on Friday to Sunday. These discount tickets are mid-flex, i.e. it is refundable to a degree. (An exception is that with the NMBS/SNCB website/app, for travels just Belgium and Roosendaal/Maastricht, they automatically give you their better fixed-rate price. In general, if you have to go through Roosendaal or Maastricht, see whether getting Belgian tickets to Roosendaal/Maastricht and then domestic Dutch tickets from Roosendaal/Maastricht is a better deal.)</p>

	  <h5 id="luxembourg">Luxembourg</h5>  
	  <p>There is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the 'normal' tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International or CFL.</p>
    	  <p>There is a range of DAY RETURN tickets for short-distance cross-border traffic between <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium and any station in Luxembourg</a>. For the standard, child, and pet tickets (children and small pets usually travel for free), these day return tickets are only available at the ticket machines and ticket counters at:</p>
		<ul>
			      <li>Trois-Ponts, Vielsalm, and Gouvy, for journeys via the Gouvy frontier</li> 
			      <li>Arlon and Messancy, for journeys via the Sterpenich or Athus frontier</li>
			      <li>Virton, Halanzy, and Aubange, for journeys via the Athus frontier</li>
		</ul>
<p>(For Athus: Belgian domestic ticketing applies in Athus, and Luxembourgish ticketing is also extended to Athus for Luxembourgish trains/buses. At Athus you can get a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or the CFL train conductor. A 2-hour ticket costs €2/€3.) NOTE: all <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgian–Luxembourgish short-distance cross-border day return tickets</a> cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Luxembourg with a one of these special Luxembourg – Arlon ticket, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Arlon with a domestic Belgian ticket. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Luxembourg pass Arlon, or catch another train at Arlon. (Clauses for standard ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/CD78FD0FFC1442F5B364FF4BE15AC331.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/294B6201AFD240E2A3476BD9FB237630.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.) CFL issues exactly the same range of day return tickets from any station in Luxembourg to these nearby Belgian stations. They can be purchased at CFL ticket offices, or for Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts/Arlon, also from CFL ticket machines. They have the same rule on not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket.</p> 
	  <p>Otherwise you can get normal international tickets, from international ticket offices, NMBS/SNCB International website, or CFL website. A normal full-flex Arlon–Luxembourg one-way ticket costs just slightly less than a special day-return between Arlon and Luxembourg (while a normal full-flex return ticket is double the price of a one-way). Other than full-flex, there are also the mid-flex tickets of youth single or return (for people 25 years or younger), and weekend return (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun). There are also the no-flex return tickets called Escapade 1/2/3: for €52/74/96 second class, or €86/135/180 first class, a return ticket within 30 days for 1/2/3 people between any station in Belgium and any station in Luxembourg. With these normal international tickets, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>	
	  <h5 id="lille">Lille and further</h5>	
	  <p>For the Lille area, there is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the international tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International.</p> 
	<p>There are two special short-distance cross-border tickets for the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille.aspx" target="_blank">Lille area</a>: <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-1-day.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline 1 day ticket</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-season-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline subscription</a>. The <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-1-day.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline 1 day ticket</a> is only available at the ticket machines and ticket counters at:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Kortrijk and Zone Mouscron (Mouscron or Herseaux), for journeys via the Tourcoing frontier</li>
			<li>Tournai and Froyennes, for journeys via the Blandain frontier</li>
			<li>(But the tariff tables (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>) also list Tournai/Froynnes via Tourcoing as an option.)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Trampoline 1 day ticket gives unlimited travel for 1 day on NMBS/SNCB trains on the Kortrijk – Lille Flandres line, or the Tournai – Lille Flandres line, as indicated on the ticket. NOTE: the Trampoline ticket, and the Trampoline subscription, cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Lille Flandres with a Trampoline ticket to Kortrijk, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Kortrijk. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Lille-Flandres pass Kortrijk, or catch another train at Kortrijk. (Clauses of the Trampoline 1 day ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/BFE66B51C0744E9692559DE83CC8204B.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/42948454596E444898CA1E3BBA99DEFF.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.)</p>
	  <p>From anywhere in Belgium, there is a mid-flex return ticket called the Trampoline Weekend ticket to Lille Flandres (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), which is 40&#37; off the full-flex price. With this Trampoline Weekend ticket, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>  
	<p>For high-speed travel between Brussels-Midi/Zuid and Lille Europe, NMBS/SNCB International has a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#AboLille" target="_blank">Brussels–Lille subscription</a>, valid on all TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar services. This can be purchased at the international ticket office at Brussels-Midi/Zuid.</p>
	<p>An 'Any Belgian Station' (ABS) option is available for TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar. For a small fixed-price, a connecting journey on NMBS/SNCB trains can be added to a TGV, Thalys, or Eurostar journey. See the FAQ for <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Connection" target="_blank">TGV</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSThalys" target="_blank">Thalys</a>, and <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSEurostar" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International.</p>
	<h3 id="breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">Breaking, detours, zones, and fares</h3>
	<p>By default, you travel on the shortest possible route in distance between the 'from' and 'to' stations. In this case, you are allowed to break your journey: feel free to stop at an intermediate point, and join a later train to continue your journey. The ticket is valid until the last service of the day (you are responsible for checking whether there are still services that allow you to complete the journey).</p>
	<p>In some cases, you are allowed take a route that is not shortest in distance. However, in these circumstances, you are not allowed to break your journey (beyond making necessary train changes):</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you can get to your destination faster;</li>
	<li>if you can avoid changing trains, and can stay in the same train, and if this journey is maximally 30 minutes longer than taking the shortest route in distance;</li>
	<li>you can backtrack along a route if by doing that, you can get to your destination faster, or if there is no connection right at the point where the two tracks intersect, or if there is a delay.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Otherwise, you are not allowed to make a detour. If you want to make a detour, you have to purchase two spearate tickets. In the NMBS/SNCB journey planner, sometimes it gives you suggestions with a warning saying that you have to buy two separate tickets for the suggested journey.</p>
	<p id="Zone">Some stations are grouped together into 'Zones'. There are 21 such Zones in Belgium; the largest of which is the Brussels Zone, covering basically the same area as the Brussels-Capital Region. These zones are indicated in the maps above as pink polygons. Each of these Zones is a single tariff point. A tickets which has a Zone as its origin and/or destination gives the traveller, on the ticket's day of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until one leaves that Zone. (When purchasing a ticket, when you type in a station that is within a Zone, I think the resulting ticket automatically has the name of that Zone as the origin/destination.) In a Rail Pass or similar ticket, you can put down a Zone as the origin and/or destination. International rail tickets that depart from or arrives at a station within a Zone in Belgium also give the traveller free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains in that Zone until one leaves that Zone.</p>
	<p>A ticket with Mortsel, Mortsel-Liersesteenweg, Mortsel-Oude God, or Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg as its origin/destination has equal validity in the other three Mortsel stations. (However, Mortsel is not a Zone, e.g. a ticket to one of the Mortsel stations does not give limitless travel amongst the Mortsel stations.)</p>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB tickets to/from Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Eijsden cost the same, and are equality valid to the other two stations. (However, Maastricht is also not a Zone.)</p>
	<p>An NMBS/SNCB return ticket from anywhere in Belgium, Roosendaal, the Maastricht stations, or Aachen Hbf to a coastal station (kuststation / gare du littoral) allows the traveller to begin the return journey from another coastal station. The coastal stations are:
Knokke, Duinbergen, Heist, Zeebrugge-Dorp, Zeebrugge-Strand, Blankenberge, Oostende, Veurne, Koksijde, and De Panne. Basically the entire coast is linked by the <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/kusttram/" target="_blank"><em>Kusttram</em> 'Coastal Tram'</a>. Ticketing of <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a>, the Flemish public transport company, applies on the Coastal Tram.</p>
	<p>Most of the points above are mentioned in the NMBS/SNCB glossary (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/A8AFD75E2FF441D9A9006F27DD659F9C.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/F9C6D129540149058BE6E25B207616D9.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>).</p>
	<p>This is the tariff tables in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>. 1 to 3 km have the same fare. For normal tickets, distances longer than 150 km are charged 150 km.</p>

<h3 id="other-public-transport-operators">Other public transport operators</h3>
<p>From the customers' points of view, other than NMBS/SNCB, there are just three other public transport companies in Belgium:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a> (Flanders)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stib-mivb.be/index.htm?l=en" target="_blank">STIB-MIVB</a> (Brussels)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonia)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Their networks overlap a little bit. Many Belgian buses cross into neighbouring countries, and many foreign buses cross into Belgium.</p>
<p>NMBS/SNCB has <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bus-tram-metro.aspx" target="_blank">various subscriptions</a> that combine travels on their trains and each of these other three other public transport operators.</p>
<p>All four Belgian public transport operators use an RFID card called <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/mobib.aspx" target="_blank">MoBIB</a>. However, currently NMBS/SNCB and De Lijn only use (personalised) MoBIB cards for subscriptions; their use for the everyday tickets has not been introduced. (On the other hand, STIB-MIVB and TEC have flat-rate ordinary tickets that can be loaded into a personalised or anonymous MoBIB card.)</p>
