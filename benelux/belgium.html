	      <p>Greetings! Here are some tips on travelling by train in/to/from/through Belgium. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips on Belgium in that page are repeated here.</p>
<p>Belgium is <em>België</em> in Dutch, <em>Belgique</em> in French, <em>Belgien</em> in German, and <em>Belsch</em> in Luxembourgish. The official language is Dutch in the north, French in the south, bilingually French and Dutch in Brussels, and there is also a small German area in the far east. For the convenience of those who are not familiar with the linguistic situation in Belgium, the boundaries of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium" target="_blank">language areas</a>, and the place names in their Dutch/French/German etc. versions are shown in the maps.</p>

<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Belgium. The following are the operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (Dutch: <em>Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen</em>, French: <em>Société nationale des chemins de fer belges</em> 'National Company of the Belgian Railways'; domestic <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.sncbnmbs.b2cmobapp" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/nmbs/id1504870215?l=en" target="_blank">iOS</a>; international <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Belgian national railway company; runs all but a few trains in Belgium. NMBS/SNCB's own network extends into all neighbouring countries.
	<ul>
		<li>The Brussels – Amsterdam InterCity is run together with NS (Dutch Rail; domestic <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301" target="_blank">iOS</a>; international <a href="https://www.nsinternational.com/en" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737" target="_blank">iOS</a>). Commonly called the 'Benelux train', this service is classed as Intercity direct (ICd) in the Netherlands. Non-high-speed trains running on high-speed lines.</li>
		<li>The Libramont – Bastogne-Nord bus service.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>CFL (domestic <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215" target="_blank">iOS</a>; international <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">booking website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cflint" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/cfl-international/id1438609651" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Luxembourgish national railway company. Near the border, CFL runs trains every half or one hour everyday to Athus in Belgium. (Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus, i.e. free in second class.)
	<ul>
		<li>Intercity Brussels/Namur/Arlon – Luxembourg is run by NMBS/SNCB. Local trains between Arlon/Kleinbettingen and Luxembourg are run by NMBS/SNCB or CFL</li>
		<li>Intercity Liège-Guillemins – Luxembourg (weekdays) or Liers – Luxembourg (weekend) is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB.</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>		
<p>The following are the high-speed rail service operators: <br/>(Unless otherwise indicated, at Brussels-Midi/Zuid ('Brussels-South') these depart from platforms 3/4/5/6, where there is sometimes security control, but no border control.)</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE International</a>: Brussels-Midi/Zuid (– Brussels-North) – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen Hbf– Cologne Hbf – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt Hbf. ICE International is a consortium between DB (German Rail) and NS (Dutch Rail). International and domesitc travel within Germany follow German long-distance ticketing rules (e.g. dynamic pricing). If travelling domestically within Belgium (Brussels – Liège), there is an ICE surcharge on top of Belgian domestic ticketing (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France" target="_blank">TGV </a> of <a href="https://be.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail): Brussels-Midi/Zuid to Lille Europe and many other destinations in France like Paris CDG Airport, but not the terminal stations in central Paris. Follows French long-distance ticketing rules (e.g. dynamic pricing).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a>: Paris Nord – Brussels-Midi/Zuid – Antwerp-C – Rotterdam C – Schiphol Airport – Amsterdam C; Paris Nord – Brussels-Midi/Zuid – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen Hbf – Cologne Hbf – Düsseldorf Hbf (– Düsseldorf Airport) – Duisburg Hbf – Essen Hbf (– Dortmund Hbf). Seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice (winter). The first and second shareholders are SNCF and NMBS/SNCB respectively. It has its own ticketing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a>: low-cost service between Brussels-Midi/Zuid and Paris Nord by Thalys. Runs half on high-speed rail line, and half on conventional rail line. It has its own fare structure, and tickets can only be booked through the IZY website or the SNCF website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/be-en" target="_blank">Eurostar</a>: <del>London St. Pancras (– Ebbsfleet I) (– Ashford I) (– Calais Fréthun) – Lille Europe – Brussels-Midi/Zuid</del>; London St. Pancras (– Lille Europe) – Brussels-Midi/Zuid – Rotterdam C – Amsterdam C. Majority owned by SNCF. It has its own ticketing. Eurostar services to the Netherlands depart from platforms 3/4/5/6. Eurostar services to <del>France and</del> England depart from platforms 1/2: passengers to England depart from the main Eurostar check-in area with full border and security checks, (currently, Eurostar tickets from Belgium to France are not bookable). <del>while passengers to France (Lille/Calais) go through a separate check-in terminal without border checks. (The carriage for France is segregated from the carriages for England.) Eurostar tickets from Brussels to France can only be booked through the Belgian Eurostar website, at least 2 days before departure. Eurostar tickets to/from the the three stations in England cost the same; a Eurostar ticket booked from one of the three stations <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/be-en/question/I-ve-booked-from-one-station-can-I-board-at-another" target="_blank">allows you to board at the other two stations</a>. Similarly, Eurostar passengers from Continental Europe can disembark at any of the three stations in England. (But not all trains stop at Ebbsfleet or Ashford.)</del></li>  
	</ul>
	<p>The following operates sleeper trains:</p>
	      <ul>
	      	<li><a href="https://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a>: Brussels – Vienna sleeper trains run by ÖBB (Austrian Rail; <a href="https://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">webpage</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.oebb.ts" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/at/app/obb/id1041401604?l=en" target="_blank">iOS</a>).</li>
	      </ul>      
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. The closest termini for OUIGO from Belgium are Tourcoing (less than 2.5 km from the border) and Lille Flandres (both on the Kortrijk – Mouscron – Lille Flandres InterCity line). Two OUIGO stations that are easily accessible from southeastern Belgium are Metz Ville and Lorraine TGV south of Luxembourg.</p>

	      <p>The regular non-high-speed services run every half or one or two hours. Based on their stopping patterns, there are the following types of regular non-high-speed train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/travel-info/train-offer/s-train" target="_blank">S train</a> (Dutch: <em>S-trein</em> / <em>voorstadstrein</em>; French: <em>Train S</em> / <em>train suburbain</em>; German: <em>S-Zug</em> / <em>S-Bahn</em>): primarily all-stops service around the five big cities of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Gent, Charleroi. Each S train line has a line number: Brussels has S1 to S10, S20, S81; Antwerp has S32 to S34 (S32 is the line to Roosendaal in the Netherlands); Liège has S41 to S44 (S43 is the line to Maastricht in the Netherlands); Gent has S51 to S53; Charleroi has S61 to S64.</li>
	<li>L train (Dutch: <em>L-trein</em> / <em>stoptrein</em>; French <em>Train L</em> / <em>omnibus</em>; German: <em>L-Zug</em> / <em>Nahverkehrszug</em>): primarily all-stops service elsewhere in the country, including the line to Aachen Hbf in Germany. L train and S train in Belgium are similar to the <em>Sprinter/Stoptrein</em> in the Netherlands, and the <em>RB</em> in Luxembourg and Germany.</li>
<li>P trains (Dutch: <em>P-trein</em> / <em>piekuurtrein</em>; French: <em>Train P</em> / <em>train d'heure de pointe</em>; German <em>P-Zug</em> / <em>Zug des Spitzenverkehrs</em>). Some are all-stops, some are like InterCity's, and many are somewhat mixed. Most P trains run on weekdays during peak hours, usually in the dominant commute direction, primarily during non-holiday periods. There are some stations and lines that are only served by P-trains, i.e. they get very few trains per day, and only during weekdays. There are also the Sunday P trains, which are aimed at sending students back to their tertiary institution on Sunday evenings during term time. P trains that run before the afternoon peak have train numbers beginning with 7, and P trains that run during or after the afternoon peak have train numbers beginning with 8.</li>
	<li>ICT trains (Dutch: <em>ICT-trein</em> / <em>toeristentrein</em>; French <em>Trein ICT</em> / <em>train touristique</em>). These are additional trains to and from popular holiday destinations. NMBS/SNCB can add extra ICT services to the coast or other tourist attractions in short notice. The ICT services are primarily run during the holiday periods. ICT trains have train numbers beginning with 66, 67, 68, or 69.</li>	
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stop service, especially towards the end of the line. Belgian IC trains make extra stops at some sections during the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>There used to be an intermediate category called the InterRegio (IR), but this category no longer exists in Belgium. They are now classified as IC. (<em>IR</em> is similar to <em>RE</em> in Luxembourg and Germany, and <em>Sneltrein</em> in the Netherlands.)</p>
<p>High-speed services:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): high-speed service between Brussels and Frankfurt</li>
		<li><em>TGV</em>: high-speed services between Brussels and various destinations in France</li>
		<li><em>Thalys</em>: high-speed service to Paris, Cologne/Dortmund, and Amsterdam</li>
		<li><em>IZY</em>: low-cost high-speed service between Brussels and Paris</li>
		<li><em>Eurostar</em>: high-speed service to Lille/London, and Amsterdam</li>
	</ul>
	      <p>Sleeper trains:</p>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>Nightjet: sleeper trains to Vienna via Germany.</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p id="maps">The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Belgium. In Belgium there are major differences between the weekdays and weekend/holiday networks. For the convenience of those who are not familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium" target="_blank">language areas in Belgium</a>, boundaries between them are shown in the maps. Official station names are given together with alternative names in various languages. The governments of the different language areas in Belgium rarely make concessions to people who are not familiar with the place names in their language. Belgian trains often cross these language boundaries multiple times in one journey, and change the language used in the announcements accordingly. (They change language even when just passing through a language area without stopping.) Place names in different languages can sound and look rather different. For instance, train announcements and road signs to <em>Lüttich</em>, <em>Luik</em>, and <em>Liège</em> all refer to the same city (in German/Dutch/French). Similarly, <em>Bergen</em> and <em>Mons</em> are names of the same city (Dutch/French), and so are <em>Anvers</em> and <em>Antwerpen</em> (French/Dutch, <em>Antwerp</em> in English).</p>

	      <h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	<p>Mirroring the complexity of the Belgian railway network, there is a myriad of ticketing options in Belgium. Here I will only introduce the most-commonly encountered ticketing issues.</p>
	      <h4 id="channels-of-purchase">Channels of purchase</h4> 
	      <h5 id="international-tickets">International tickets</h4>
	      <p>NMBS/SNCB International's <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a> and app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301" target="_blank">iOS</a>) are easy to use. Other than inputting the 'from' and 'to' stations, you can also input a 'via' station for international journeys. If it can compute your desired journey, it gives you a list of possible itineraries. You choose one of them, it shows you the details of the journey, and ticket conditions. You press 'book' for the journey that you want to book. You then input your personal details. The payment methods are Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, PayPal, Bancontact (Belgian card), and iDEAL (Dutch online transfer). If payment is successful, a ticket is issued. For most destinations, an e-ticket is delivered. See <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Delivery" target="_blank">ticket delivery methods</a>.</p>
	      <p>Some ticket offices/counters can handle international tickets. In 20+ major stations, they offer the full range of international tickets offered by NMBS/SNCB International. In another 20+ smaller stations, they can handle tickets to international destinations directly reachable from them (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of such stations). Other than purchasing tickets at a ticket counter, tickets can also be purchased via telephone. For tickets purchased at a ticket counter or via telephone, in many cases they charge a service fee of €5/€9/€14 (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">here</a>). Tickets purchased via telephone, or tickets purchased online that cannot be delivered as an e-ticket, can be picked up for free at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#PickupStations" target="_blank">48 Belgian stations and 6 Dutch stations</a>. (For tickets that can be issued as an e-ticket, but you choose to pick it up at a station, there is a handling fee of €6.)</p>
	      <p>Since this year (1 Feb?), Belgian ticket machines can handle tickets for all short-distance cross-border services run entirely by NMBS/SNCB:

	      <h5 id="tickets-purchased-from-nmbs-sncb-train-conductors-and-fines">Tickets purchased from NMBS/SNCB train conductors, and fines</h5>
	      <p>Domestic and some cross-border tickets can be purchased on board NMBS/SNCB trains. However, buying a ticket on board incurs a <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/on-board-fare/" target="_blank">fee of €7</a>. See that page for exceptions; the main exceptions are:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>you buy a <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee" target="_blank">Brussels Airport supplement</a> (Brussels Airport-Zaventem station access fee; €5.5).</li>
		      <li>you buy a ticket departing from the following places outside Belgium: Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, Eijsden, Roosendaal (Netherlands), Aachen (Germany), Lille (France), and any station in Luxembourg.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Notice that the list of exempted foreign departure points DOES NOT include: a) Aulnoye Aymeries and Maubeuge in France (buying tickets on board will incur the €7 onboard surcharge); b) Breda and destinations further north on the Intercity from Amsterdam (without a valid ticket on board in the Netherlands, you may get a fine of €50).</p>
	      <p>Go to a train conductor before they come to you. If you don't have a valid ticket and fail to buy a ticket on board, you will get a fine of €75 in Belgium.</p>
	      <p>The ticket that you get from a train conductor is an RFID card (contactless card). If you need a receipt, or need to read the data off an RFID card issued to you, you can tap the card on the card reader at a Belgian ticket machine.</p> 
	      <p>An RFID ticket issued on board cannot be used to travel from Belgium to a neighbouring country.</p>
	      <h5 id="domestic-tickets-via-the-nmbs-sncb-app">Domestic tickets via the NMBS/SNCB app</h5>
<p>At the NMBS/SNCB domestic app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.sncbnmbs.b2cmobapp" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/nmbs/id1504870215?l=en" target="_blank">iOS</a>), you start by using the journey planner. If you press a suggested itinerary that is purely domestic, and involves only NMBS/SNCB trains, at the bottom of the suggestion is a button which says 'buy ticket'. Check the details of the ticket: Product (i.e. <a href="#types-of-tickets">ticket type</a>), From, To, Number of passengers, Date, Type/Class (single/return/1st class/2nd class). 'Via' is not possible with Belgian domestic tickets. Breaking of journey along the shortest route between the 'From' and 'To' stations is allowed, but if you make a detour, you have to buy two separate tickets (see <a href="#breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">below</a>). Methods of payment are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Bancontact, Belgius Direct Net, KBC Online, PayPal. After the transaction is succesfully processed, the ticket is stored in the app.</p>
	      <h5 id="domestic-tickets-via-the-nmbs-sncb-website">Domestic tickets via the NMBS/SNCB website</h5>
	      <p>This is the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">domestic ticketing webpage</a>. You fill in the journey details and the personal details of the traveller(s). Payment methods accepted are Bancontact, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, BNP Paribas Fortis, Belgius, KBC/CBC</p>
<p>The delivery method is pdf, or, for a purely domestic journey, Belgians can choose to have the e-ticket recorded electronically in their Belgian national ID card (you input the ID card number before payment).</p>
	      <h5 id="domestic-and-cross-border-tickets-via-belgian-ticket-machines-and-ticket-counters">Domestic and cross-border tickets via Belgian ticket machines and ticket counters</h5>
	  <p>Some stations have ticket counters. They sell the whole range of domestic tickets (except internet-only tickets). The ticket counters at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">these stations</a> can sell international tickets. They may charge a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">ticket-issuing fee</a> for international tickets.</p>
	      <p>There are ticket machines at all Belgian stations. In Germany and the Netherlands, there are Belgian ticket machines at Aachen Hauptbahnhof, Roosendaal, Maastricht, and Maastricht Randwyck (but apparently not at Eijsden). You can choose from Dutch, French, German, and English language at the ticket machines. They take Visa, Bancontact (Belgian cards), MasterCard, Maestro, and American Express. Some also take coins.</p>
	      </p>They sell the whole range of domestic tickets (except internet-only tickets). Since this year (Feb 1?), in addition to tickets to the NMBS/SNCB destinations in the Netherlands (<a href="#netherlands">Maastricht, Roosendaal</a>) and Germany (<a href="#germany">Aachen Hbf</a>), the destinations in France (<a href="#france">Lille, Aulnoye Aymeries, Maubeuge</a>) and <a href="#luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> are also purchasable from their machines throughout Belgium. (However, 1. last time I checked, while Aulnoye is there, Maubeuge is not in the machine; 2. the smaller stations across the border in France or the Netherlands before the terminus is not necessarily there, and now the price of going to these closer-by smaller stations is cheaper than going to the terminus.) Not purchasable from the machines are the IC service to Breda or further north, and high-speed rail servcies. The Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands and Germany have a somewhat restricted range of tickets on offer. For instance, the NMBS/SNCB Standard Multi (Rail Pass), which is not valid outside Belgium, is apparently not sold there.</p>

	      <h4 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets: domestic and cross-border</h4>
	      <p>There is a plethora of <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/overview-products/" target="_blank">ticket types</a> sold by NMBS/SNCB for domestic and short-distance cross-border journeys. Here I will only introduce the commonnest domestic tickets. Most of these had a <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/news/new-product-names" target="_blank">name change</a> in 2020; instead of separate Dutch and French names, in most cases unified English names are used in both Dutch and French.</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/standard-ticket" target="_blank">Standard Ticket</a> (old names: <em>Standaardbiljet</em> / <em>Billet Standard</em> / <em>Standardfahrkarte</em>): full fare single ticket, or day return ticket. Return is just double the price of a single ticket.</li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/weekend-ticket" target="_blank">Weekend Ticket</a> (old names: <em>Weekendbiljet</em> / <em>Billet Week-end</em> / <em>Wochenendfahrkarte</em>): weekend return for basically the same price as a normal one-way Standard Ticket. Departure and return can be at any time on Friday from 19:00, Saturday, or Sunday. Also valid on certain other days, e.g. during long weekends (see the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/weekend-ticket" target="_blank">Weekend Ticket page</a> for the exact dates of these holidays).</li>

	<h4 id="bicycles-and-pets">Bicycles and pets</h4>

	<h4 id="summary-of-purchase-channels-and-ticket-types">Summary of purchase channels and ticket types</h4>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB provides this <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/support/customer-service/sales-channels" target="_blank">summary</a> for the various channels of purchase and types of tickets.</p>
	<h3 id="breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">Breaking, detours, zones, and fares</h3>
	  <h4 id="breaking-and-detours">Breaking and detours</h4>
	  <p>By default, you travel on the shortest possible route in distance between the 'from' and 'to' stations. In this case, you are allowed to break your journey: feel free to stop at an intermediate point, and join a later train to continue your journey. The ticket is valid until the last service of the day. (But make no assumptions on how late trains might run till.)</p>
	<p>In some cases, you are allowed take a route that is not shortest in distance. However, in these circumstances, you are not allowed to break your journey (you can make the necessary train changes, but not leave the station). You can take a route that is not the shortest in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you can get to your destination faster.</li>
	<li>if you can avoid changing trains, and can stay in the same train, and if this journey is maximally 30 minutes longer than taking trains along the shortest route in distance.</li>
	<li>you can backtrack along a route if by doing so, you can get to your destination faster, or if there are no connecting services right at the point where the two tracks intersect.</li>
	<li>if there is a delay.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Otherwise, you are not allowed to make a detour. If you want to make a detour, you have to purchase two spearate tickets. In the NMBS/SNCB journey planner, sometimes it gives you suggested itineraries with a warning saying that you have to buy two separate tickets for the suggested journey.</p>
	  <h4 id="Zone">Zones, 'non-zones', and fares</h4>
	  <p>Some stations are grouped together into 'Zones'. There are 21 such Zones in Belgium; the largest is the Brussels Zone, covering the same area as the Brussels-Capital Region. (The station of Linkebeek, which straddles the border of Brussles and Flanders, lies outside the Brussels Zone.) These zones are indicated in the <a href="#maps">maps above</a> as mauve polygons. Each of these Zones is a single tariff point. A domestic or international ticket which has a Zone as its origin and/or destination gives the traveller, on the ticket's day of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until one leaves that Zone. (When purchasing a ticket, when you type in a station within a Zone, I think the resulting ticket automatically has the name of that Zone as the origin/destination.) In a Standard Multi (Rail Pass) or similar ticket, you can put down a Zone as the origin and/or destination.</p>
	<p>A ticket with Mortsel, Mortsel-Liersesteenweg, Mortsel-Oude-God, or Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg as its origin/destination has equal validity at the other three Mortsel stations. However, Mortsel is not a Zone, e.g. a ticket to one of the Mortsel stations does not give limitless travel amongst the Mortsel stations.</p>
	<p>An NMBS/SNCB return ticket to a coastal station (<em>kuststation</em> / <em>gare du littoral</em>) allows the traveller to return from another coastal station. The coastal stations are:
Knokke, Duinbergen, Heist, Zeebrugge-Dorp, Zeebrugge-Strand, Blankenberge, Oostende, Veurne, Koksijde, and De Panne. Basically the entire coast is linked by the <a href="https://www.dekusttram.be/en/" target="_blank"><em>Kusttram</em> 'Coastal Tram'</a>. Ticketing of <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a>, the Flemish public transport company, applies on the Coastal Tram.</p>
	<p>Most of the points above are mentioned in the NMBS/SNCB glossary, which can be found in the NMBS/SNCB terms and conditions (<a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/nl/support/terms-and-conditions-for-transport" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/fr/support/terms-and-conditions-for-transport/" target="_blank">French</a>). Also in the terms and conditions are the tariff tables. For ordinary single tickets, 1 to 3 km have the same fares, and distances longer than 150 km are charged 150 km on domestic NMBS/SNCB services.</p>

<p>NMBS/SNCB has <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/train-and-other-transport/train-bus-tram-metro" target="_blank">various subscriptions</a> that combine journeys on their trains and one of the other public transport operators.</p>
<p>All four Belgian public transport operators use an RFID card called <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/travel-info/prepare-for-your-journey/mobib-card" target="_blank">MoBIB</a>. However, for NMBS/SNCB and De Lijn, they only use personalised MoBIB cards for subscriptions. STIB-MIVB and TEC, on the other hand, use MoBIB cards for both subscriptions and timed tickets.</p>

	  <h4 id="special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-netherlands">Special short-distance cross-border tickets</h4>	  
	      <p>There is a range of tickets to <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/roosendaal/" target="_blank">Roosendaal</a> and <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/maastricht/" target="_blank">Maastricht</a> in the Netherlands on the NMBS/SNCB local trains. The Roosendaal line has one station, Roosendaal, in the Netherlands, while the Maastricht line has tree stations: Eijsden, Maastricht Randwyck, and Maastricht. (In the past these three stations are priced the same, but now they are priced differently.) Ticket machines in Belgium and the NMBS/SNCB international website/app can handle tickets to/from these stations. (The domestic NMBS/SNCB website now directs all Roosendaal/Maastricht tickets to the international site.) There are also Belgian ticket machines at Maastricht and Maastricht Randwyck, but apparently not at Eijsden. The range of tickets available from these ticket machines in the Netherlands is somewhat smaller, e.g. the Standard Multi (Rail Pass) is apparently not available. The domestic <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/bike-ticket" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> is also valid on these NMBS/SNCB services. A ticket from/to Roosendaal or Maastricht can be used back-to-back with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train (there are probably no domestic tickets left that prohibit combination with an international ticket, but check). For instance, you can use an NMBS/SNCB Standard Multi (Rail Pass) up till Visé near the Dutch border, and then present another ticket between Visé and Maastricht, while sitting in the same Belgian train. (Terms and conditions for the standard tickets in <a href="https://cdn.belgiantrain.be/-/media/files/pdf/productfiches/nl/standard-ticket-maroaa.ashx" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="https://cdn.belgiantrain.be/-/media/files/pdf/productfiches/fr/standard-ticket-maroaa-fr-20200305.ashx" target="_blank">French</a>.)</p>

	  <p>Belgian ticket machines cannot handle tickets for the IC train to Breda and further north. You have to get tickets for this from the Belgian rail international website/app, or from ticket offices that can handle this international journey.</p>
<p>There is also the <em>Euregio ticket</em>, which is valid on many non-high-speed rail services and buses/trams in the Belgium/Netherlands/Germany tripoint region. See <a href="netherlands.html#euregio">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>Some train stations in the Netherlands have <a href="netherlands.html#check-in-portals">gates</a>. Stations that have gates include Roosendaal, Breda, and Amsterdam Centraal, while stations that do not have gates include Maastricht and Schiphol Airport (January 2021). Belgian tickets include a barcode for opening these station gates in the Netherlands if the destination requires one.</p>

	  <p>For non-high-speed train tickets between Belgium and the Netherlands, there is the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/InterCity/Fares" target="_blank"><em>Early Bird</em></a> deal: a fixed discount is given (i.e. no need to book too early) if booked seven or more days before the departure date. The discount is on average 40&#37; off full-fare for Monday to Thursday departures, and 20&#37; off for Friday to Sunday departures. These discount tickets are mid-flex, i.e. it is refundable to a degree. The same deal is also given in the Netherlands for non-high-speed travel to Belgium, and to Luxembourg via Belgium. These deals are best booked online, because in Belgium, ticket offices and telephone booking usually charge a booking fee, and in the Netherlands, ticket machines and the normal ticket counters do not sell discounted tickets, while the international ticket offices and telephone booking charge hefty booking fees for tickets that you cannot get from ticket machines. Children 11 years old or younger travel for free if they are accompanied by an adult 18 years old or older. (Each such adult can take with them at most 4 children for free.)</p>
	  <p>(If it is just between Belgium and Roosendaal/Maastricht, NMBS/SNCB automatically give you their better fixed-rate fare. In general, if you have to go through Roosendaal or Maastricht, see whether getting Belgian tickets to Roosendaal/Maastricht and then domestic Dutch tickets from Roosendaal/Maastricht is a better deal than getting one ticket the entire way.)</p>
	  <p>For a small fixed-price (starting from €7.6 second class, €11.6 first class), a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Connection" target="_blank">Connection ticket</a> on NMBS/SNCB trains can be added to a Thalys or Eurostar ticket to/from the Netherlands.

<p>There is a range of tickets to <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/aachen/" target="_blank">Aachen Hauptbahnhof</a> in Germany on NMBS/SNCB local trains. (Aachen is <em>Aken</em> in Dutch, and <em>Aix-la-Chapelle</em> in French.) Ticket machines in Belgium and the NMBS/SNCB international website/app can handle tickets to/from Aachen Hbf on NMBS/SNCB trains (but not on Thalys, ICE, or Nightjet trains). (The NMBS/SNCB domestic website no longer handles tickets to Aachen Hbf.) There are also Belgian ticket machines at Aachen Hbf. However, the range of tickets available there is smaller (e.g. the Standard Multi (Rail Pass) is apparently not available there). The domestic <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/bike-ticket" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> is also valid on the NMBS/SNCB L train to/from Aachen. A ticket to/from Aachen can be used back-to-back with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train (there are probably no domestic tickets left that prohibit combination with an international ticket, but check). For instance, you can use an NMBS/SNCB Standard Multi up till Hergenrath near the German border, and then present another ticket between Hergenrath and Aachen Hbf, while sitting in the same Belgian train. (Terms and conditions for the standard tickets in <a href="https://cdn.belgiantrain.be/-/media/files/pdf/productfiches/nl/standard-ticket-maroaa.ashx" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="https://cdn.belgiantrain.be/-/media/files/pdf/productfiches/fr/standard-ticket-maroaa-fr-20200305.ashx" target="_blank">French</a>.)</p>

	  <p>Unlike the widespread 'incursion' of German local public transport and ticketing into the <a href="netherlands.html#germany">border areas in the Netherlands</a>, German local ticketing is very rarely valid in Belgium. The Aachen regional <a href="https://avv.de/de/" target="_blank">AVV</a>-Tarif and the state-wide <a href="https://infoportal.mobil.nrw/nrw-tarif/nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick.html" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a> are NOT valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf.</p> 
	<p>(With buses, the only bus line where normal local German tariff is valid for some distance in Belgium is <a href="https://avv.de/de/linienfahrplaene?query=&trafficLine=50&type=" target="_blank">ASEAG bus 24</a> between Kelmis Bruch in Belgium and Aachen Bushof in Germany. In other cases, normal German tariffs stop at the first bus stop before or after the border. Joint German–Belgian bus fare in the Aachen area is handled through a special tariff called <a href="https://avv.de/de/tickets/tickets-fuer-bus-bahn/region3tarif" target="_blank">region3tarif</a>. The next two German public transport authorities to the south, <a href="https://www.vrs.de/en/" target="_blank">VRS</a> (Cologne/Bonn) and <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/en/" target="_blank">VRT</a> (Trier), have no bus services to Belgium, although some are right on the border. The Belgian–German border area south of the Aachen region lies in the Eifel mountain range, and is very lightly populated in general.)</p>
	  <p>There is the <em>Euregio ticket</em>, which IS valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf, plus many other non-high-speed rail services and buses/trams in the wider Belgium/Netherlands/Germany tripoint region. See <a href="netherlands.html#euregio">here</a>.</p>

	  <p>For ICE tickets between Belgium and Germany (or beyond), it seems that the <em>Sparpreis Europa</em> and <em>Super Sparpreis Europa</em> saver fares no longer give a free connecting trip within Belgium. For destinations outside the Brussels and Liège zones, Check the price for the entire journey, versus booking the ICE and Belgian domestic legs as two separate tickets.</p>

<p>Also read further in the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg</a> page. (Luxembourg here refers to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, as opposed to the Province of Luxembourg in Belgium.</p> 
<p>Public transport within Luxembourg (except for first-class on trains) has become zero-fare since 1 March 2020. Since 2021 (Feb 1?), tickets to Luxembourg can be purchased from any ticket machine in Belgium. You have to specify whether you enter Luxembourg via the Gouvy, Sterpenich, or Athus frontier. Tickets to Luxembourg can also be purchased from the NMBS/SNCB International website/app or international ticket offices.</p>
<p>For Gouvy and Sterpenich frontiers, there is a cross-border charge (included in a ticket). Athus is different: Athus station in Belgium is considered a domestic destination by both Belgian and Luxembourgish rail, meaning that normal Luxembourgish tarif applies between Athus and the border on trains, i.e. zero-fare on second class. For first class rail tickets, there are no Luxembourgish ticket machine in Athus, but a ticket can be obtained from the train conductor with a €1 surcharge.</p>
	  <p>The <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/InterCity/Fares" target="_blank">range of tickets offered to Luxembourg</a> is similar to the range of domestic Belgian tickets, e.g. stardard, weekend return, senior, youth, child. Normal domestic bicycle and pet tickets are required in Belgium, but they are carried for free in Luxembourg.</p>

	  <p>NMBS/SNCB runs its own non-high-speed trains to three destinations just across the border in France: <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/lille" target="_blank">Lille Flandres</a> via the Tourcoing or Blandain frontier (you can choose either border frontier point), <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/maubeuge-aulnoye-aymeries" target="_blank">Aulnoye Aymeries</a> via the Quévy frontier, and <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/international/just-outside-belgium/maubeuge-aulnoye-aymeries" target="_blank">Maubeuge</a> via the Jeumont frontier. Tickets to these can now (since Feb 1? 2021) be purchased from a ticket machine throughout Belgium. (However, last time I looked at a Belgian ticket machine far away from the border, while Aulnoye was available, Maubeuge was not.). Alternatively, these tickets can be purchased from the NMBS/SNCB international website/app, or international ticket ofices. (The old Trampoline and cross-border tickets have been discontinued. Unlike the flat-charge in the past, the stations in between Lille and Kortrijk / Tournai now have normal distance tarif, plus border-crossing charge if applicable.)</p> 
	  <p>(In the other direction, from the French regional train ticket machines in the region ('TER', blue in colour), choose FRANCE/BELGIQUE from the home screen for these tickets. In French, Kortrijk is <em>Courtrai</em>; <em>Courtrai</em> and <em>Tournai</em> look somewhat similar; do not get them mixed up. Also note that in Dutch, Lille is <em>Rijsel</em>, and Tournai is <em>Doornik</em>.)</p>	  
	  <p>Belgium classes these train services as Intercity, while France classes these as TER (regional services). The Lille services run all day, while the Aulnoye and Maubeuge services only have two return services per day each (these are aimed at connecting with French domestic TER services to/from Paris Nord).</p>  
	<p>If you buy a ticket from an NMBS/SNCB train conductor at Aulnoye Aymeries or Maubeuge, or within Belgium, they charge you a €7 <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/on-board-fare/" target="_blank">on-board surcharge</a>. The on-board surcharge is not applicable at Lille.</p>
	<p>This is the official webpage of <a href="https://www.sncf-reseau.com/fr/documentation/toutes-nos-cartes" target="_blank">rail maps of France</a>. This is the website of <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/hauts-de-france" target="_blank">SNCF TER Hauts-de-France</a> (local rail network in far northern France), and <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</a> (local rail network in northeastern France). Although there are no direct passenger rail links between Grand Est and Belgium, some stations are close to Belgium, e.g. Givet, Longwy.</p>
	  <p>The <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/InterCity/Fares" target="_blank">range of (non-high-speed) tickets offered</a> to Lille, Aulnoye Aymeries, Maubeuge, and other TER Hauts-de-France destinations is similar to that to domestic Belgian destinations, e.g. standard, weekend return, senior, youth, child. Normal domestic bicycle and pet tickets are required on NMBS/SNCB trains. Bicycles are carried for <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/hauts-de-france/gares/ter-intermodalite/combinez-vos-deplacements/train-et-velo" target="_blank">free</a> on TER Hauts-de-France trains.

	<p>The following is a list of rail services in Belgium that: a) are tourist-/enthusiast-oriented; b) run 'between destinations' (e.g., not running entirely within a theme park or grounds of a preservation association); and c) run entirely or mostly on railway not served by regular passenger train services. These touristic rail services run on very limited schedules, and they are also relatively expensive. However, you get to experience the history of rail transport, as they usually run on antique vehicles that are difficult to see elsewhere. Excluded in the following list (currently?) are most historical tramways and narrow-gauge railways. The information below is shown in the <em>weekend local train</em> <a href="#maps">maps above</a>.</p>
