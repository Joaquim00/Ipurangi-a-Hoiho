<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Belgium. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about Belgium in that page are repeated here.</p>  
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in the Netherlands. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Belgium (plus the Netherlands and Luxembourg).</p>

<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (Dutch: <em>Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen</em>, French <em>Société nationale des chemins de fer belges</em> 'National Company of the Belgian Railways'; <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The national railway company; runs all but a few trains in Belgium. NMBS/SNCB's own network is extended into all of its neighbouring countries: a little into the Netherlands, Germany, France, and all the way into Luxembourg City from two directions.
	<ul>
		<li>The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity is run together with NS (Dutch Rail; <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). These services run on the Antwerp – Rotterdam high-speed line, and for the vast majority of Amsterdam services, also on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed line. The ones that go through the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed line are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, there is an <a href="netherlands.html#surcharges">ICd supplement</a> for domestic ICd trips through the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed line, but this supplement (surcharge) is not applicable to tickets to/from/through Belgium. These InterCity/Intercity direct services are commonly called the 'Benelux train'. (Despite the name, these services have never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg.)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The Luxembourgish national railway company. Near the Belgian–Luxembourgish border, CFL runs frequent trains everyday to Athus. (Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus with CFL trains and Luxembourgish buses.) On weekdays, CFL also runs a few peak trains to Virton and Gouvy.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators (unless otherwise indicated, at Brussels-South they depart from platform 3/4/5/6, where there is  security control sometimes, but no border controls):</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (consortium of NS and DB); Brussels-South – Brussels-North – Liège – Aachen – Cologne (– Cologne/Bonn Airport) – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt. Cross-border or domesitc travel within Germany follows German long-distance ticketing rules. If travelling domestically within Belgium (Brussels – Liège), there is an ICE surcharge (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail). Brussels (–Lille) and then to other destinations in France like Paris CDG Airport (but not to the main Paris stations). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a>. Paris/Lille – Brussels – Antwerp – Rotterdam – Schiphol – Amsterdam; Paris – Brussels – Liège – Aachen – Cologne – Düsseldorf (– Düsseldorf Airport) – Duisburg – Essen (– Dortmund); seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille. It has its own ticketing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a>. Low-cost service between Brussels-South and Paris-Nord by Thalys (runs half on high-spee rail, and half on conventional rail). It has its own fare structure, and tickets can only be booked through the IZY website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (London (–Ebbsfleet) (–Ashford) (–Calais) – Lille – Brussels; London – Brussels – Rotterdam – Amsterdam). It has its own ticketing. Eurostar services to the Netherlands depart from platforms 3/4/5/6. Eurostar trains to France and England depart from platforms 1/2: passengers to UK depart from the main Eurostar check-in area with full border and security checks; passengers to France (Lille/Calais) go through a separate check-in terminal without border checks (Eurostar tickets from Brussels to France can only be booked through the Belgian Eurostar website, at least 1.5 days(?) before departure.)</li>  

	
	
	
</ul>
<h3 id="train-types">Train types</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, there are the following train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Sprinter</em> (term primarily used by NS) or <em>Stoptrein</em> (term only used by the other companies): all-stops service; occationally one or two stations are skipped</li>
	<li><em>Sneltrein</em>: a rarely encountered intermediate category; only operated by Arriva, all run in parallel to <em>Stoptrein</em> services on the same lines. From north to south:
		<ul>
			<li>Leeuwarden – Groningen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden – Emmen</li>
			<li>Zwolle – Coevorden (peak supplemantary service)</li>
			<li>(Maastricht Randwyck –) Maastricht – Heerlen</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. All domestic InterCity services are operated by NS, except the Raalte – Enschede IC service which is operated by Keolis/Blauwnet. The Amsterdam – Berlin InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and DB. The The Hague – Brussels InterCity service is jointly operated by NS and NMBS/SNCB</li>
	<li><em>Intercity direct</em> (ICd): semi-high-speed service; domestic Amsterdam Centraal – Schiphol Airport – Rotterdam Centraal (– Breda) is operated by NS; International ICd runs further from Breda into Belgium, and is operated jointly by NS and NMBS/SNCB</li>
	<li>High-speed services:
		<ul>
	<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): high-speed service between Amsterdam and Frankfurt or Basel</li>
	<li><em>Thalys</em>: high-speed service between Amsterdam and Brussels/Lille/Paris</li>
	<li><em>Eurostar</em>: high-speed service Amsterdam Centraal – Rotterdam Centraal – Brussels Midi/Zuid – London St. Pancras International</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Nachtnet</em> services are domestic InterCity services that run between approximately 00:00 till 05:00. Utrecht – Amsterdam – The Hague – Rotterdam are linked every night. During the weekend there are one or two Nachtnet services to some other cities. Many ordinary train services also run till some time past 00:00, or even 01:00; one difference between these ordinary services and the Nachtnet services is that the ordinary services get <a href="#accessibility-issues">assisted boarding service</a> till the last train (at stations where this service is available), but the Nachtnet services has no assisted boarding service. Nachtnet services have the same ticketing as the other NS services. Tickets are valid for services with a scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, before 04:00 the following day.</p>

<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
<p>There are two main types of tickets: e-ticket, which comes with a barcode, and OV-chipkaart, which is an NFC ticket.</p>
	      <h4 id="e-app-tickets">E-tickets</h4>
	      <p>E-tickets are tickets bought from websites or apps of the public transport providers. For trains:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li> 
		<li>NS <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></li>
	      </ul>
<p>The NS domestic website sells tickets for all domestic train journeys, including trains that are not run by them. The websites/apps of the other public transport providers also sell products that are spcific to them.</p>	
	<p>E-tickets have a barcode. You have to provide travel details like the 'from' and 'to' stations (the NS websites/apps don't seem to be able to issue a ticket if you add a 'via' station), date, single/return (for domestic tickets, return is within a day), and class of travel (first vs. second class). Other than travel details, you also have to provide personal details of the traveller, like name and date of birth (the ticket can only be used by the named person). Many e-tickets bought from the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic NS website</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/" target="_blank">NS International website</a> with a destination in Belgium or Germany, can have the E-ticket loaded to their respective apps. Otherwise it has to be printed out on a piece of A4 paper. When using an e-ticket, you have to be able to show an ID if asked.</p>
	<p>The domestic NS website/app does not give discounted e-tickets. With the NS International website/apps, it will automatically give you a range of prices. You can also specify railway subscription that you have, and the relevant discount(s) is/are applied automatically.</p>	      
	<p>A good deal that can be purchased from the domestic NS website is the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren" target="_blank">off-peak group ticket</a>.</p>
	      <p>When using an e-ticket, checking in and out at the check-in portals are not required. The barcode can be used to open closed gates at train stations. Some gates have readers that can only read OV-chipkaarts, while other can read both e-ticket barcodes and OV-chipkaarts. There is always at least one gate that can read e-ticket barcodes.</p>
	      <h4 id="ov-chipkaart">OV-chipkaart</h4>
<p>OV-chipkaarts are near-field communication (NFC) cards; you place an OV-chipkaart near the reader (within centimetres), it is read by the reader, and it is validated if everything is in order (the reader beeps and shows a green light). There are disposable OV-chipkaarts, and durable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<h5>Disposable OV-chipkaarts, and Dutch Rail ticket machines/ticket counters</h5>
<p>Disposable OV-chipkaarts are short-term tickets issued by train-ticket machines. All domestic tickets and many international tickets issued at ticket counters are also disposable OV-chipkaarts. <a href="https://www.ret.nl/en.html" target="_blank">Rotterdam</a> and <a href="https://en.gvb.nl/" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> also issue their short-term public transport tickets in the form of disposable OV-chipkaarts.</p>
<p>NS has <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">three types of ticket machines</a>. The usual ticket machines have a blue sign with the NS logo. These give disposable OV-chipkaart tickets. (Machines which has a yellow sign with the word <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em>, and narrow machines which say <em>saldo opladen</em>, are for people who already possess a durable OV-chipkaart).</p>
<p>NS ticket machines and the normal ticket counters sell the same range of single/return tickets, and charge the same ticket-issuing fees. For domestic single/return tickets, the issuing cost of a disposable OV-chipkaart is €1, which is added to the normal ticket price. This €1 fee does not apply to, e.g., <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> (children's ticket), <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-fiets" target="_blank">bicycle ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-hond" target="_blank">dog ticket</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/alleen-te-koop-via-station-of-kaartautomaat/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a> (for the NL/BE/DE tripoint region), and international tickets that Dutch ticket machines or normal ticket counters can handle. The Dutch ticket machines and the normal ticket counters can handle tickets to many destinations in Belgium and Luxembourg, and some closer or larger destinations in Germany (see <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/destinations-purchasable-at-ticket-machines" target="_blank">here</a> for the list of possible destinations). They can handle a very limited range of ICE tickets to Germany (no seat reservation), but they cannot handle Thalys or Eurostar tickets to Belgium or further.</p> 
	<p>Other than the normal NS ticket counters, there are seven <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/tickets-services/opening-hours-ticket-and-service-shops" target="_blank">NS International ticket offices</a> where you can purchase the full range of international tickets that NS International offer. However, for international tickets that the NS ticket machines cannot handle, the NS International offices charge a <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/where-to-buy/stations-service-offices" target="_blank">service fee</a> of €7.5 per person, to a maximum of €22.50 per booking. (It is best to purchase tickets online in general.) Most NS International ticket offices also have self-service computers where you can make your own booking online through the normal NS International website (no service fee), and print the ticket(s) out.</p>
	<p>With an NS ticket machine, you can switch between Dutch and English language. The main screen has three main options: single tickets, return tickets, and other tickets. When purchasing a domestic single/return ticket:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the 'from' station is by default the station where the machine is located, but you can also change the 'from' station by pressing the 'from' button.</li>
		<li>the most popular 'to' stations are displayed. If your intended destination is not on the list, you have to key in the first one or two letters of the name of the station, and then a list of stations that begin with those letter(s) will appear. Press the button with the name of your inteded destination. Some destinations are not train stations; they combine <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/overige-kaartjes/p/trein-tram-bus-enkel" target="_blank">train and tram/bus travel</a>. For instance, if you look for destinations that begin with 'E', there are 'Efteling' (theme park) and 'Eindhoven Airport' which are not names of railway stations; tickets to these give you the right to travel on trains and also on a connecting bus.</li>
		<li>choose the date, and class of travel (first or second class). For domestic return tickets, the return journey has to be made within the day. A ticket is valid for trains of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is before 04:00 the following day. If you want to travel after that, you need another ticket that is valid for that day.
		<li>pay. Ticket machines DO NOT take banknotes. Some machines take coins. All machines take bankcards and credit cards (V PAY, Maestro, Visa, Mastercard; €0.5 surcharge for credit card). When using cards, the flow of procedures is: insert card, wait, withdraw card when it tells you to, input PIN code, press OK. Then the ticket comes out of the machine if the transaction is successful. (Credit cards are now accepted at all ticket machines and online.)</li>
	      </ul>		
	<p>To purchase an international ticket from a ticket machine, the option for purchasing international tickets is embedded within the 'other tickets' option at the initial screen. (Alternatively, if you have pressed the single/return ticket option at the initial screen, you will only discover, after many steps, that these options are only for domestic tickets. A small button for purchasing international tickets will eventually appear in the corner.) </p>
	<p>With Dutch ticket machines, other than a 'from' and 'to' station, you can also specify a 'via' station. (You can break a journey between the 'from' and 'to' station; you only need to specify a 'via' station if it involves a detour.) If your journey involves options between trains of different companies, usually it will ask you which option you want to take. (If not, you will have to specify a 'via' station to clarify the route you want to take.) With some international trips, you have the option of specifying which border point you will cross.</p>
<p>Ticket machines no longer give discounted tickets. To benefit from samenreiskorting (see <a href="#samenreiskorting">below</a>), one needs to have a durable OV-chipkaart.</p>
	      <p>On the southern border, there are Belgian ticket machines at Roosendaal, Maastricht, and Maastricht Randwyck. (But apparently not at Eijsden.) On the eastern border, there are German ticket machines in at least Hengelo, Venlo, Arnhem Centraal, and Enschede. (They can at least deal with tickets for German local trains. The ones in Arnhem Centraal cannot deal with German long distance trains.) With the Eurobahn/Keolis Deutschland line between Hengelo and Bielefeld (RB 61), there are ticket machines inside the trains. Further north, Dutch Arriva ticket machines, and OV-chipkaart portals, are extended into Weener and Leer in Germany.</p>
<h5>Durable OV-chipkaart</h5>
<p>Durable OV-chipkaarts are valid for five years. For regular public transport in European Netherlands, they are valid on all trains, metros, trams, the vast majority of buses (e.g. not in Schiermonnikoog), and some ferries. It is also valid on the Arriva trains (and replacement buses) to Weener and Leer in Germany, and some cross-border buses.</p>
	<p>There are anonymous OV-chipkaarts and personal OV-chipkaarts. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts can be used by anyone, and the normal retail price is €7.5. (This is just the retail price, not a deposit!) Each OV-chipkaart can only be used by one person at a time; children 4 years old or above need their own ticket/OV-chipkaart. Anonymous OV-chipkaarts are sold at ticket machines, ticket counters, and at some shops (search for OV-chipkaart sales points <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Personal OV-chipkaarts is for one particular person, whose details and photo are printed on the card. A personal OV-chipkaart also cost €7.5, but it is given out for free in some cases, e.g., when you order certain <em>annual</em> <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS subscriptions</a>. Otherwise, for people with an address in Benelux or Germany, one can ask for a personal OV-chipkaart from the <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart website</a>. (For people living elsewhere, <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/everything-about-travelling/different-types-of-passenger/tourists.htm" target="_blank">it is complicated</a>, and more expensive.)</p>
	      <p>Credit (i.e. money) can be added to a durable OV-chipkaart through ticket machines of NS, other Dutch railway companies, and many other public transport providers. NS has <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/ns-ticket-machines.html" target="_blank">ticket machines</a> which are just for people with durable OV-chipkaarts (ones which says <em>OV-chipkaarthouders</em> or <em>saldo opladen</em>). There are also many free-standing OV-chipkaart terminals (they are yellow in colour) where one can add credit to an OV-chipkaart with a bankcard. On the internet, one can also add credit, or purchase subscriptions from public transport providers. However, after the online transactions, you still need to go to a ticket machine, or one of the many dedicated OV-chipkaart terminals (some of which are inside buses/trams), to load the product purchased online into the OV-chipkaart. <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/service-and-contact/service-points-finder.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find OV-chipkaart service points. There are machines that can deal of OV-chipkaarts throughout European Netherlands, and the Arriva stations in Weener and Leer in Germany.</p>
	      <p>(On the other hand, asking for a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/applying-for-a-credit-refund.htm" target="_blank">refund</a> from an OV-chipkaart is not straightforward.)</p>
	      <p>Credit is automatically deducted as one checks the card in and out during one's journey. As one checks in, a deposit is charged to the card when one checks in at a check-in portal. The deposit is between €0 to €20, depending on the public transport company, type of OV-chipkaart, type of subscription that one has, etc. (Without an NS subscription, the deposit for catching NS trains is €20.) One can only successfully check in if, after the deposit, the credit in the OV-chipkaart is not under negative €4. When one checks out, a refund is given if the fare is lower than the deposit, or extra credit is charged if the fare is higher than the deposit.</p>
	       <p>If you want to change the class of travel, you have to do that <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-2-1" target="_blank">at a ticket machine</a>. Read the Dutch page, or ask, if you want to make a permanent change of travel class.</p>
	      <p>With a durable OV-chipkaart, checking out and then back in again at the same station within 35 minutes is consider a transfer. (One long journey, including transfers, is cheaper than the same route covered by consecutive shorter separate journeys). Take note, that when you check in again, the balance in the card could have gone too low for you to be charged a deposit again. Your change of class (see above) or <em>samenreiskorting</em> status (see below) could have ended when you check out the first time.</p>
	      <p>To cancel a check-in, the deposit is refunded if one checks out again at the same station within 60 minutes. However, with NS, one cannot check out within 100 seconds of checking-in; this is to prevent people from double-tapping the card, accidentally checking out after they have checked in. (You can also use this method to check whether you have already checked in. Another method is to check your travel history at a ticket machine.)</p>
<p>If you have forgotten to check in, try to check in before you step into a train. (In places with open gates, remember to check in on the 'check-in side', i.e. the side that is outside the paid area.) If you are already inside a train, contact the conductor. If not, you risk a fine. If you have forgotten to check out, you can go back to the station where you ended your journey and check out there within six hours of the last check-in. If not, go to a service counter of the public transport provider and ask for help. Failing that, try contacting <a href="https://www.uitcheckgemist.nl/?locale=en" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart</a>.</p>
<p>One can check the credit in a card, or the travel history of the card, at ticket machines. Or at the OV-chipkaart website/app if the card is linked to an account registered with the OV-chipkaart website/app.</p>
	     <p><em>Abonnementen</em> and 'peak time': <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">NS</a> and other public transport providers have various subscriptions that give discounted or unlimited travel of some sort. When peak/non-peak is referred to, <em>non-peak</em> is most usually 18:30–06:30 and 09:00–16:00 on weekdays, and the whole day on weekend and holidays. On non-holiday weekdays: a) you can check in with non-peak rates a few (five?) minutes before 09:00 or 18:30 on weekdays; b) the non-peak rate is valid as long as the scheduled departure time of the train that you catch, at the station where you board the train, is before 06:30 or 16:00.</p>
	      <p id="samenreiskorting"><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/combined-travel-discount.html" target="_blank"><em>Samenreiskorting</em></a>: people with NS subscriptions (except Kids Vrij) can take three other travellers along with them, and they enjoy 40% discount during off-peak. These co-travellers need to activate the <em>samenresikorting</em> option in their own OV-chipkaart beforehand, through a ticket machine.</p>
	      <h5>Other forms of NFC tickets</h5>
	      <p>The trial for <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ovchipmobiel.htm" target="_blank">OV-chip mobiel</a> (OV-chipkaart system with NFC-enabled smart phones) ends at 15 June 2018. (I don't know what plans they have for this mode of payment in the future.)</p>
	      <p>As far as I know, there is nowhere in the Netherlands where you can use a contactless bankcard/creditcard to check in and out with public transport. (Many buses and trams are cash-less, while others are aiming to become cash-less in 2018. Many buses/trams have bankcard/creditcard payment terminals.)</p>
	      <h4 id="promotional-tickets-and-tourist-tickets">Promotional tickets and 'tourist tickets'</h4>
	      <p>NS runs various promotional tickets (but you'll need Dutch reading skills). Some are sold through its own <a href="https://www.spoordeelwinkel.nl/" target="_blank">online store</a>, while others are sold in coorporation and through other physical or online stores. One place where these various deals are summarised is <a href="https://www.treinreiziger.nl/category/treinkaartjes/" target="_blank">treinreiziger.nl</a>. Ones that are sold at physical stores can be disposable OV-chipkaarts, or a code which you turn into an e-ticket on the internet (they come with instructions, in Dutch).</p>
	      <p>NS sells the following 'tourist tickets':</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/amsterdam-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam Travel Ticket</a>: €16/€21/€26 for 1/2/3 days. One return journey (?) on the train between Schiphol Airport and {the Amsterdam– stations, or Duivendrecht}, unlimited travel on GVB trams/buses/metros/ferries, and the airport express bus 397 or N97. (Cost-wise, this is comparable to GVB's own 24/48/72 hour tickets €7.5/€12.5/€17.5, plus €8.5 worth of train travelling. Check the rules carefully.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/uitleg-overige-producten/p/amsterdam-region-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam region travel ticket</a>: €18.5/€26/€33.5 for 1/2/3 days. Valid for unlimited trips on NS trains, and buses/trams/metros/ferries run by GVB, EBS, Connexxion in the 'Amsterdam region'. (Click the map to open a larger version in another tab/window.)

	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/holland-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Holland travel ticket</a>: €39 'off-peak' (i.e. not during 06:30–09:00 weekdays), €55 whole-day. Covers all Dutch train and bus/tram/metro travel. (€39 is on the expensive side, and €55 is too-expensive; but it is convenient for tourists.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart" target="_blank">Day ticket</a>: €50.6, unlimited travel on Dutch trains for an entire day. (Too expensive. You can do much better with promotional tickets.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/overige-kaartjes/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a>: €18.5, unlimited travel for one day on buses and many train lines in southern Dutch Limburg province, Belgian Limburg and Liège provinces, and Aachen region in Germany. During the weekend and holidays, it is valid for two adults and three children under 12 years old. Best if you bring the <a href="https://avv.de/de/service/downloads?file=files/avv/files/tickets/flyer/euregioticket.pdf" target="_blank">brochure</a> along, as some train conductors / bus drivers might not know what it is (speaking from experience). Check very carefully what train and bus lines are or are not covered in each province/region. In the map of the brochure: a) with trains, the blue dotted lines are railway lines that the Euregio ticket is valid on, while the grey dotted lines are lines where it is NOT valid on. In Germany, it is only valid on local trains (S-Bahn, RB, and RE). It is also not valid on Thalys, ICE, and EuroNight; b) with buses, the Euregio ticket is valid on all buses in this region (but check the range of public transport operators listed). The red lines are just some example bus lines.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h4 id="check-in-portals">Check-in portals</h4>
<p>If you hold an e-ticket, this section does not concern you; you do not need to check in or out. The barcode in your e-ticket (on a piece of paper, or in a mobile app) can be used to open closed gates at stations.</p>
	<p>For holders of OV-chipkaarts: there are two types of check-in portals: poles and gates. The check-in poles are just standing structures where you tap your card for checking in or out. On the other hand, check-in gates have barriers which, if closed, restrict access to the platforms, and only open as one checks in or out with with an OV-chipkaart. (Some stations have gates that are not closed, for at least part of the day. You still need to check in or out at these open gates.) Whether stations have gates or not is not relative to the size of a station; some very small stations have gates, while some large stations do not have gates.</p>
<p>There are four system of check-in portals: NS, Arriva, Blauwnet, and Valleilijn. When catching trains of these four companies/brands, use the corresponding check-in portals. For companies other than these four, use the non-NS ones that are present, except for these three that use NS portals: a) in the west, R-net Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn (which is run by NS), b) in the deep south, NMBS/SNCB Maastricht – Eijsden, and c) in the deep south, DB Regio Heerlen – Eygelshoven Markt. (Information in 2018; c, and perhaps b, will change in 2019.) This information is displayed in some of the maps, two of them repeated here:</p>

</div>
<br/>
<p>There are not many stations where two systems intersect; the vast majority of them are in the east of the country. There is only one station, Zutphen, where three systems intersect. You do not need to check out and then in again if you are changing between trains of the same system. If you change between two systems, there are check-in poles of each system standing next to each other on the platforms; you check out of one system, and then in with the other system.</p> 
<p>There are some stations where metro and NS trains share the same paid area behind gates, or even either sides of an island platform; you can find their respective check-in poles standing next to each other.</p> 
<p>All metro stations have OV-chipkaart ticket gates. On the other hand, with buses/trams/waterbuses, their card readers are inside the vehicle; you have to check in and out of each individual bus/tram/waterbus that you board.</p>
<h4 id="surcharges">Surcharges</h4>
      <ul>
	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>: travellers can travel on the ICE service domestically in the Netherlands (Amsterdam Centraal – Utrecht Centraal – Arnhem Centraal) with a normal domestic ticket, plus an ICE supplement. The supplement is €2.4, and can be purchased as an e-ticket, a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart. The ICE supplement is not applicable to passengers with an NS subscription (that is valid on the section travelled on), NS-business card, student subscription, student subscription, or children passengers travelling on Railrunner or Kids Vrij. The ICE supplement is also not applicable to international ICE tickets to/from the Netherlands.</li>
	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>: when travelling domestically in the Netherlands, on either the domestic or international ICd service, there is an Intercity direct supplement on the high-speed rail between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal. The ICd supplement is €2.4, and it can be purchased online as an e-ticket, or from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee; but this option is not necessarily available in ticket machines not along the ICd route). For people with a durable OV-chipkaart, there are ICd supplement poles at Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam Centraal, and Breda, where you can tap your OV-chipkaart once before you board the train. (DO NOT tap the ICd supplement pole again after you get off the train.) This year (2018) the ICd supplement is temporarily lowered to €1.4 if it is paid by tapping an ICd supplement pole DURING OFF-PEAK. The ICd supplment is not applicable to passengers with an international ticket that goes to/from/through Belgium and covers the Schiphol–Rotterdam section.</li>
      </ul>
	<h4 id="children-seniors-bicycles-pets">Children, seniors, bicycles, and pets</h4>
	<h5>Children and seniors</h5>
	<p>0 to 3 year-olds do not need to pay; they (may, but) do not have the right to occupy a seat.</p> 
<p>Children 4 to 11 years can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket, which costs €2.5 for one day. It can be purchased as an e-ticket from the NS website, as a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing cost), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart. With a Railrunner ticket, a child 4 to 11 years old: a) can travel independently in second class(!); or b) has to be accompanied by an adult 18 years or older with a valid ticket in first class; each such adult can accompany at most three children, each with their own Railrunner ticket.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for people with an NS subscription, they can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/kids-vrij.html" target="_blank">Kids Vrij</a> subscriptions for at most three children, each costing €0.01 a year (in 2018). The only extra cost is €7.5 if they need do not already have a personal OV-chipkaart. A child travelling on Kids Vrij has to be accompanied by a passenger 12 years or older with a valid ticket. Each such older passenger can accompany at most three children, each with their own Kids Vrij subscription.</p>
	<p>Railrunner and Kids Vrij are valid for all train travel in the Netherlands (except Thalys and Eurostar). If it is in an OV-chipkaart, check in and out as usual. Children on these do not have to pay the ICE supplement or the ICd supplement. For international travel: a) in Germany, with <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/familie/fahrkarten_fuer_kinder.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>, children under 6 do not need a ticket; older children under 15 years old can have their names be added to their parent's or grandparent's ticket, and these children travel for free; otherwise tickets for 6-14 year-olds are half the adult price; b) <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/reduction/children.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium</a>; c) <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/la-gratuit%C3%A9-de-transport/enfants" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>.</p>
	      <p>There are no special single or return tickets for students or seniors. However, there are special subscriptions for local students, and seniors get extra privilages with the usual subscriptions.</p>
	      <h5>Bicycles</h5>
	      <p>Folding bicycles that are fully folded up are treated as normal luggage, and can travel on trains for free at all times. For other bicycles, the NS bicycle ticket is valid for all Dutch railway companies. However, Arriva has better deals with some of their lines.</p>
	      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/luggage/means-of-transport-on-the-train.html" target="_blank">Nederlands Spoorwegen</a>: with a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-fiets" target="_blank"><em>dagkaart fiets</em></a> 'bicycle day-ticket' (€6.2), bicycles are allowed onboard outside peak time (06:30–09:00, 16:00–18:30) during weekdays, the whole day during weekends and holidays, and the entirety of July and August.

	      </ul>
<p>When doing your own search on the internet about bicycle transportation, words to search for are <em>fiets meenemen</em> in Dutch, <em>Fahrradmitnahme</em> in German, and <em>vélo à bord</em> or <em>voyager avec vélo</em> etc. in French.</p>
	<h5 id="pets">Pets</h5>
	<p>A smaller pet that fit in a small carry case or sit on your lap do not need a ticket. A larger pet needs a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-hond" target="_blank">dog ticket</a> (€3.1), valid for NS and Arriva. Clearly identifiable guide dogs and trainee guide dogs (e.g. ones showing logos of guide dog organisations) do not need a dog ticket.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-and-detour">Breaking and detours</h3>
<p>Except for non-flexible high-speed-rail tickets, breaking of journey is allowed. Feel free to stop at an intermediate point. The ticket (a disposable OV-chipkaart, or a paper ticket issued in other countries) is valid for services (on the designated route) of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is earlier than 04:00 the following day. Durable OV-chipkaarts needs to be checked out within six hours of the last check in, and checking in again within 35 minutes of the last check out is considered a transfer (a continuation of the same journey).</p>
<p>NS and the Leeuwarden/Groningen lines of Arriva charge fares based on 'tariff units' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1522750534329/content/assets/ns-nl/voorwaarden-folders/2018/tariefeenheden-vz-2018-update-april.pdf" target="_blank">map (April 2018)</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/consumer-rates.html" target="_blank">rates</a>; for discounted rates, NS rounds to the nearest 10 cents, while Arriva rounds to the nearest 1 cent). Each unit is roughly 1km in distance, but some sections charge more tariff units than actual distance. 0-8 units cost the same, and the price increases with each unit unitl 200 units. Journeys within the Netherlands that are longer than 200 units are charged 200 units. Other companies/lines have tariffs based on the actual distance in km, plus a flagfall. (If one begins a journey with NS, and ends with another company, the return journey along the same route can have a different price, due to the difference in tariff rules, especially the flagfall rules.)</p>
<p>If a ticket only states a 'from' station and a 'to' station, you are meant to take the shortest route between the 'from' station and the 'to' station. Near two opposite ends of a railway loop, the tariff units are often configured so that it cost the same to travel through either side of the loop, despite slight difference in actual distance. For instance, a ticket from Amsterdam Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal, without further qualifications, allows the traveller to travel on the faster InterCity via Den Haag HS (the western route), or the slower Sprinter via Breukelen (the eastern route), despite the travel distance being not exactly the same. Both are charged 86 units on purpose (second class full fare €15.4). The new Intercity direct (ICd) travels on a much shorter route, but it also charges 86 units (plus an ICd supplement of €2.4 for the high-speed line between Schiphol and Rotterdam). Check route suggestions and price information given by the NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/ target="_blank">website</a> or app.</p>
<p>When there are track works or accidents, which affect the journey stated in your ticket, you can use your ticket as usual, and take the detour recommended by the railway companies. If you're using a durable OV-chipkaart, you are meant to check in and out as usual along your detour. Train conductors have hand-held devices which have real time information on track works and accidents.</p>

	<p>This is the NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-a-functional-disability" target="_blank">disability page</a>. It has information for passengers with various types of special requirements.</p>
	<p>For passengers with, e.g., visual impairment, mobility requirements, NS has a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-a-functional-disability/assistance-while-travelling.html" target="_blank">travel assistance</a> service. Many local trains are wheelchair-accessible, but, unfortunately, most faster trains aren't. Travel assistance is available at many stations; railway staff can help pre-booked passengers get on and off trains. You need to make a request at least one hour beforehand, giving them the details of your intended travel (date, time of departure, departure and arrival stations). Many conditions and procedures are changing on 5 June 2018; from that date, other than the usual telephone number of +31 30 2357822, you can make a request through the NS app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), or through <a href="ns.nl/reisassistentie">ns.nl/reisassistentie</a>.

<h3 id="german-trains-and-ticketing">German trains and ticketing</h3>
	<p>Several German rail services extend into the Netherlands. For domestic trips within the Netherlands on these trains, Dutch ticketing applies. Within Germany or for cross-border travels, German ticketing applies. (The only place where Dutch ticketing extends into Germany is the northernmost cross-border line east from Groningen into Weener and Leer in Germany.)</p>
	<p>The most important distinction in train types in Germany is that between <em>Fernverkehr</em> 'long distance transport', and <em>Nahverkehr</em> 'short distance transport', or local trains. The commonnest types of long distance trains are Intercity-Express (ICE), Intercity (IC), and EuroCity (EC). The commonest types of local trains are Interregio-Express (IRE), Regional-Express (RE), Regionalbahn (RB), and S-Bahn (S). Most usually, long-distance trains have different pricing from local trains. This is similar to France, but different to Benelux, where InterCity's have the same pricing as local trains. (Sometimes there are exceptional sections of long-distance services which have local-service pricing.)</p>
	<p>As for long-distance services, there is the Amsterdam – Frankfurt ICE service, and the Amsterdam – Berlin IC service. International travelling on these services follow German-type long-distance ticketing rules, and have dynamic pricing. (You can book these either through <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a> or <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>.)</p>
	<p>As for local services, there are many tickets that are valid for local trains and other public transport throughout a state, or more locally at the level of a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbund</em></a> 'transport authority'. There are two German states that border the Netherlands: <em>Niedersachsen</em> 'Lower Saxony' in the north, and <em>Nordrhein-Westfalen</em> 'North Rhine-Westphalia' (NRW) to the south. As for transport authorities, the public transport in most areas in Germany are organised by transport authorities. This is a map of the German <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Karte_der_Verkehrsverb%C3%BCnde_und_Tarifverb%C3%BCnde_in_Deutschland.png" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbünde</em></a> from German Wikipedia. In areas in Lower Saxony bordering the Netherlands, the transport authorities only coordinate the ticketing and operation of the buses, and not the trains (grey in the map: VEJ, bvE, VGB). In North Rhein-Westphalia, on the other hand, the four transport authorities coordinate the ticketing and operation of both the local trains, and also the U-bahn/trams/buses (yellow in the map: WT, VRR, AVV, VRS).</p>
	<p>In Lower Saxony, there is the <a href="http://www.niedersachsentarif.de/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsentarif</a>, which is a unified fare structure for the local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Breman, and some bordering regions, including Hengelo and Oldenzaal in the Netherlands with German local trains. The <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsenticket</a> costs €23/27/31/35/39 for 1/2/3/4/5 people, giving unlimited travel on local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Breman, and some bordering regions for a day. In some areas (none bordering the Netherlands), U-Bahn/trams/buses are also included. There is also the <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/niedersachsen-ticket-plus-groningen/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsenticket plus Groningen</a>, which costs €28/33/38/43/48 for 1/2/3/4/5 perople. This has the same validity as the Niedersachsenticket, plus an extension on the Dutch Arriva line between Weener and Groningen. The validity map can be seen in the links above. In interactive map of the local trains in Lower Saxony is <a href="<a href="https://www.lnvg.de/interaktive-karte-streckennetz/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), there are four local transport authorities (<a href="https://www.westfalentarif.de/de/start/" target="_blank">WT</a>, <a href="http://www.vrr.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">VRR</a>, <a href="https://avv.de/de/startseite" target="_blank">AVV</a>, <a href="https://www.vrsinfo.de/" target="_blank">VRS</a>), each having unified ticketing for all local trains and U-Bahn/trams/buses in their areas. All the local German trains from NRW into the Netherlands are covered by their tickets, as well as some cross-border buses. (Check carefully for each bus route whether Dutch and/or German ticketing applies on which sections.) Other than the tickets of the transport authorities, there are also the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/hintergrund-nrw-tarif/der-nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick/" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a> tickets, which covers the local trains/U-Bahn/trams/buses of the four transport authorities. For their <em>PauschalpreisTickets</em> 'flat rate tickets' (time-based tickets that are not trajactory-restricted), they also cover the German local trains from NRW into the Netherlands, as well as some cross-border buses. The best known of these flat-rate NRW tickets are the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-single/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW Single</a> (€30.5 for 1 person for one day), and the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-5-personen/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW 5 Personen</a>(€45 for 5 people for one day). The validity map of NRW-Tarif for local trains is at the bottom of <a href="http://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumente/01_Tickets_und_Tarife/01_Tickets_im_NRW_Tarif/NRW_Tarif_A-Z/Basismedien_2018/Flyer_NRW_Regionalverkehrsplan_2018.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>: NRW-Tarif is valid on the coloured lines, including the grey lines in Germany and the Netherlands. The dotted lines are added validity of the flat-rate tickets (as opposed to the trajectory tickets). NRW-Tarif is not valid on the black lines, e.g. RB 61 between Hengelo and Rheine, the Belgian local train line from Aachen Hbf.</p>

<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Belgium laid the first railway in Continental Europe in 1835 (Netherlands laid its first in 1839, and Luxembourg in 1845). The three countries have well developed railway networks, connecting the vast majority of towns and cities. Within Benelux, rail is the fastest – and certainly the most convenient – way to travel between many larger city centres.</p>
<p>Press the menu buttons for tips on train travel specific to each country, including videos. Below are all the network maps that I have drawn for the regular passenger train services in Benelux in 2018. (They are repeated in the country-specific pages, with further comments.) Due to the complexity of the networks, especially that of Belgium, I have opted to not present everything in one map. The differences in the weekdays vs weekend services is very noticeable in Belgium, and less so in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. (Click on the thumbnails to open the pdf's.)</p>

<p>The following are some notes on train travel in Benelux in general (see also the country-specific pages!):</p> 
<p>Ticketing matters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The national railway companies are: 
	<ul>
		<li>Netherlands: NS (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Belgium: NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Luxembourg: CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	There is more than one company running trains in each country. The domestic websites/apps of the national railway companies can handle tickets for all regular domestic train journeys, even ones that are not run by them. The international websites/apps can handle tickets to most destinations elsewhere in Benelux, many destinations in France and Germany, and some major destinations further afield. For international journeys, the price given by different companies can be slightly different. (See the individual country pages for comments on their ticket machines.) Bordering Benelux are France and Germany. If you are going to/from/through France or Germany, you may also want to check with their national railway companies for, e.g., price, range of international tickets/destinations:
	<ul>
		<li>France: SNCF (<a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sncf.fusion" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/oui-sncf-voyages-en-train/id343889987?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Germany: DB (<a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, to buy a ticket, just input details like the 'from' and 'to' stations, the date, single/return, and class of travel (first vs second class). No need to buy separate tickets if change of train/company is needed. The train companies also sell tickets to certain locations that are not railway stations, e.g. secondary airports; these tickets combine travelling on trains and connecting buses/trams/metros. If you want to make a detour between your 'from' and 'to' locations, there is also a 'via' option in the ticket machine/website/app. The exception to this is for domestic travel in Belgium: you have to buy two separate tickets if you make a detour. (Unless if your origin/destination is in a 'Zone'; see the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page. See also the <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> and <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> pages on how their national railway companies handle passengers breaking journeys and making detours differently.) Luxembourg has a time-based fare structure for the entire country; see below and the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg</a> page.</li>
	<li>Some trains have <em>dynamic pricing</em>, especially the high-speed trains. Basically this means that the earlier you book a ticket, the better price you get. Tickets for <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv" target="_blank">TGV</a> of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (France – <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv-france-brussels" target="_blank">Brussels</a>/Luxembourg), <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (England – France – Belgium, London – Brussels – Rotterdam – Amsterdam) and <a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (France – Belgium – Netherlands/Germany) have dynamic pricing, and seat reservation is compulsory. (Seat reservation is already included in an ordinary TGV/Eurostar/Thalys ticket; you'll have to make your own reservation if you're using a Eurail/Interrail pass.) For tickets that <em>include sectors in Germany</em>, <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/trains/long-distance/ice-ice-sprinter.shtml" target="_blank">ICE</a> of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a> (Netherlands/Belgium – Germany) and InterCity (e.g. <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin" target="_blank">Amsterdam – Berlin</a>) also have dynamic pricing, but seat reservation is optional. (Cheaper tickets for ICE/InterCity/EuroCity in Germany restrict the traveller to specific trains, while full-fare tickets give flexibility.) <a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a> (Brussels – Paris) and <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">Ouigo</a> (France domestic) are lost-cost high-speed rail services; they are basically train-versions of budget airlines. (The closest Ouigo stops from Belgium and Luxembourg: <em>Tourcoing</em> near Lille (France) / Mouscron (Wallonia) / Kortrijk (Flanders); <em>Metz-Ville</em> or <em>Lorraine TGV</em> south of Luxembourg.)</li>
	<li>Other trains have <em>fixed pricing</em>. The number of tickets on sale is unlimited, and there is no seat reservation. In Benelux, InterCity and local trains of the same company have the same pricing structure (unlike Germany and France where InterCity and local trains are priced differently). 
	<ul>	
		<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, you can use any train(s) (which do not require seat reservation) along the route indicated on the ticket, throughout the day, for a single/return journey. (However, there could be a surcharge; see below.) The base fare of a return ticket is just two times the price of a single ticket. In some cases there is a separate ticket-issuing cost, which means that a return ticket can be marginally cheaper than two single tickets.</li> 
		<li>In the Netherlands, there are some trajectories where more than one company runs trains; if there is a price difference, which there usually is, when you buy a ticket the machine/website/app will show you the price difference, and ask you to specify which company's train(s) you will catch. There is also a third option which allows you to take either option.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, there is a time-based fare structure covering nearly all modes of public transport within the country: CFL trains, foreign trains with domestic sections in Luxembourg, Luxembourgish buses, and Luxtram. There is a 2-hour ticket, and a day ticket. For buses, there are similar tickets for Luxembourgish buses that travels across the border. For trains, there are also special return tickets to some closest-by international destinations. (See also the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg page</a>.)</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li>For non-high-speed train travels between the Netherlands and Belgium, NS and NMBS/SNCB offer a fixed-rate discount for tickets bought seven or more days in advance from their international websites (<a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a>) or apps (see above). The discount is larger for journeys on Monday to Thursday. There is no seat reservation, and you can use any train during the day along the designated route, crossing a specific frontier point. The number of tickets is limitless; the discounted price remain the same seven or more days in advance (i.e. there is no need to book a lot earlier than seven days ahead), while the normal full-flex price remain the same throughout. The discounted tickets are less-flexible (for changes and cancellation) than the normal full-flex tickets. <em>No discount is given by the ticket machines!</em> (This cross-border discount is not applicable to journeys between just Roosendaal and Belgium, or between just Maastricht and Belgium, as these are operated solely by NMBS/SNCB. The old day-return and weekend-return tickets between the Netherlands and Belgium were scrapped on 9th April 2018.)</li>
	<li>Between the Netherlands and Luxembourg: if going through Belgium, then the aforementioned Belgian-Dutch rules apply; if going through Germany, you'll likely go on ICE/IC, and German dynamic pricing applies. Going through Belgium is probaly faster and cheaper. But if you have to book tickets within seven days, it is also worth looking into going through Germany instead of Belgium. This is especially the case for Dutch cities like Arnhem and Venlo close to the German border. Even to/from Amsterdam it could be (marginally?) cheaper going through Germany (but the cheapest German tickets have no flexibility).</li>
	<li>Surcharges (no seat reservation is possible for these):
	<ul>
		<li>For the Amsterdam–Berlin InterCity service, domestic travel within the Netherlands on this service is just like any other domestic InterCity services, and there is no surcharge.</li>
		<li>For ICE, domestic travel within the Netherlands requires normal domestic ticketing plus an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases this surcharge is waived). For domestic travel on the ICE within Belgium, the surcharge is €8 for second class, and €12 for first class (tickets sold at international ticket counters).
		<li>For Intercity direct, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases discounted) for the high-speed rail line between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal in the Netherlands. This surcharge is not applicable to tickets to/from/through Belgium and through Schiphol – Rotterdam.</li>
		<li>The station of Brussels Airport-Zaventem has a station access fee (the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">Diabolo fee</a>) of €5.30, for each passenger passing through the ticket gates each time. (See <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/tickets/diabolo-fee-to-airport/no-diabolo.aspx" target="_blank">who</a> are exempt.)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There are the <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en" target="_blank">Interrail</a> and <a href="https://www.eurail.com/en" target="_blank">Eurail</a> rail passes. (Interrail is the cheaper option available to European citizens and residents; see <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en/help/ordering-pass/do-i-need-interrail-or-eurail-pass" target="_blank">here</a> for eligibility for Interrail vs. Eurail.) These rail passes are not the best value (for people with simple itineraries at least), but give huge flexibility. Interrail/Eurail treats Benelux as one country for their rail passes. A one-country Benelux pass can be used by residents outside Benelux. Just for comparison, with a sample intinerary of Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam on three separate days, catching only Intercity direct and InterCity (i.e. no seat reservations):
	<ul>
		<li>Interrail adult second class Benelux one-country pass, three days in a month: €121 (or €40.33 per day).</li> 
		<li>Buying individual tickets online, for travelling within the next few days, second class full fare: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €46.8, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €70. Total = €160.4.</li>
		<li>For travelling a week later, purchased online: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €25/€33, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €38/€48. Total = €106.6 (all journeys on Mon-Thurs)/ €124.6 (all journeys on Fri-Sun).
		</ul></li>
	<li>RailPlus gives 15 percent off <em>full-fare tickets</em> for international train travel between many European countries, <em>on trains without compulsory reservation</em>. Given that this is a discount off full-fare tickets, and the discount is now only 15% (it used to be 25% before 2018), in a lot of cases it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. Using the same Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam trip as an example, it costs a traveller with a Dutch <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/dal-voordeel.html" target="_blank"><em>Dal Voordeel</em></a> subscription (40%-off off-peak within the Netherlands) plus RailPlus (15% off in Belgium and Luxembourg when crossing borders), travelling off-peak second class: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €33.2, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €37.2, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €52.9. Total = €123.3.
	<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, you need to have an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">anuual subscription</a> first; then a RailPlus card cost €15.</li>
		<li>In <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Railplus" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/railplus/railplus" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>, a RailPlus card costs €50, or €25 for 0-25/60+ year-olds.</li>
		<li>In Germany, RailPlus is included in a DB <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/vorteile/railplus.shtml" target="_blank">BahnCard</a> subscription.</li>
		<li>In France, SNCF gives 25% discount for travels to Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg (and also Spain for youths) with their <a href="https://www.oui.sncf/promotion-train/multi/europe/carte-abonnement" target="_blank"><em>cartes</em></a>. It says <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/RailPlus" target="_blank">here</a> (information is not necessarily up to date) that RailPlus is not valid in France for 26-59 year-olds.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>For people making multiple long-ish trips in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB has a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/now-and-then/rail-pass.aspx" target="_blank">Rail Pass</a> for 10 trips in a year between any stations in Belgium for €77 (second class) (see also the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page). The pass can be purchased by anyone, and it can be used by multiple people travelling together. For the same Brussels &#62; Luxembourg one way journey (normal price €43.6, second class), the Brussels &#62; Arlon domestic leg cost €7.7 with this NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, and the Arlon &#62; Luxembourg international leg costs €10.5. You can remain in the train throughout; you just need to fill the details of your Brussels &#62; Arlon journey in the NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, and have pre-purchased the Arlon &#62; Luxembourg international ticket. (On non-holiday weekdays there are trains from Arlon south to Athus; for railway travel, Athus is the only station in Belgium that Luxembourg extends domestic pricing to, so the whole Brussels &#62; Athus &#62; Luxembourg one-way journey costs €7.7 plus €2~€3. It takes more time though.) People younger than 26 years old get even better deals from NMBS/SNCB.</li>
	<li>People residing outside Europe (including Turkey and Russia) can purchase a <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/passes/german-rail-pass.shtml" target="_blank">German Rail Pass</a>. In Benelux, it covers the Brussels – Liège – Aachen – Cologne <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE</a> line, and the <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/bus/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB IC Bus</a> lines to Belgium and the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>If you do not have a valid ticket before you board a train (there are no ticket machines inside trains):
		<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/deferred-payments.html" target="_blank">fine of €50</a>, which is the same for all Dutch railway companies. And you also have to buy a ticket from them.</li>
		<li>In Belgium, you can go to the train conductor (attendent) and buy a ticket. (DO NOT wait till the train conductor comes to you.) However, there is a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">surcharge of €7</a> for all journeys that begin in Belgium (i.e. the surcharge is not applicable if you join a Belgian local/IC train in a neighbouring country). See also their <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/boordtarief.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. If you fail to buy a ticket, the fine is €75.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">tickets</a> can be bought from a train conductor with a €1 surcharge per ticket. You can buy a 2-hour-ticket or 1-day-ticket from the conductor. If you are caught without a valid ticket in a train/bus/tram in Luxembourg, the fine is €150.</li></ul>
Playing dumb tourist basically never works. Train conductors are authorised to check your ID and issue you a fine. If all the ticket machines don't work and there is no other way of purchasing a ticket at a station, theoratically this information will show up in the train conductors' hand-held devices, and you'll avoid a surcharge/fine in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is also not difficult to purchase a ticket via the apps of the railway companies (familiarise yourself with the apps before getting to a station). If you lose your ticket (e.g. if your belongings are stolen), go and seek help from a train conductor, and you will not be fined if they are satisfied that your case is genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other matters concerning travelling on regular trains:</p>
<ul>	      
	<li>Like other European countries, trains that do not have compulsory seat reservation have two classes of travel/tickets: first class and second class. You can tell which carriages/ which section of a carriage is first or second class by a big number 1 or 2 next to the doors, and the difference in the colour of the seats. Long distance train carriages have two sets of exterior doors, one near each end of the carriage. In the Netherlands, a first class section is usually just between the front and back doors, or sometimes half the length of that, with the first class section separated from the rest by glass doors. In Belgium, however, the first class section can be the entire carriage, including the seats that are further forward than the front doors/ further backward than the back doors. Check the colour of the seats carefully.</li> 
	<li>In some smaller trains, the first class seats are just a few seats at the very front or very back of the train, with or without a glass door separating those from the rest of the carriage. Some smaller trains have no first class seats.</li> 
	<li>Having a ticket, either first class or second class, does not guarentee a seat. With a second class ticket, you can walk through a first class section to get to another second class section, but you are theortically not allowed to travel while standing in a first class section, not even when the second class sections are packed full of standing passengers. (This is the case with the Netherlands; I assume this is also the case with Belgium and Luxembourg. If in doubt, ask.)</li>
	<li>If you have a high-speed rail ticket, do not assume that you can automatically catch a slower train over the same trajectory if, e.g., you miss your designated high-speed train. For instance, if you have a Thalys or Eurostar ticket from Amsterdam to Brussels or further, DO NOT assume that you can therefore catch the slower Intercity direct to get to Brussels. After all, 1) a cheap Thalys/Eurostar Amsterdam–Brussels ticket is cheaper than the full-fare Intercity direct ticket that you have to buy on the spot; and 2) Dutch Rail does not have shares in Thalys or Eurostar. Similarly, ICE in Belgium is run by Dutch Rail and German Rail; if you have an ICE ticket from Brussels to Germany, DO NOT assume that you can use that ticket to catch a Belgian train to Liège and spend some time there before heading to Germany. If you miss your high-speed train, ask railway staff, they might be able to help you (e.g. your ticket might actually be flexible enough to allow changes even after the departure time). If it is the railway company's fault that you miss your train connection, they should be able to help you. (But don't count on them helping you if you miss your last possible connection. Accidents can happen; it is best to avoid having to rely on the last possible connection, or even the last few possible connections.)</li>
	<li>At major train stations there could be security checks before one boards a train, especially with high-speed trains in <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Journey#SecurityChecks" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and France. Check the websites of the high-speed rail companies for security check arrangements. Arrive at the station/platform with ample time to spare.</li>
	<li>For Eurostar passengers going from Brussels to England, there is a <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/be-en/travel-info/your-trip/check-in" target="_blank">check-in procedure</a>, full-scale security check, Schengen immigration check, and UK immigration check at Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi ("Brussels-South"). (Customs check is conducted at arrival in UK. For Eurostar passengers going to just France, there is a separate check-in terminal at Brussels-South.) The Dutch and British governments have not yet come to agreement on British immigration and security arrangements at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal, so for journeys from the Netherlands to London, Eurostar put customers on Thalys or Eurostar trains to get to Brussels-South first, where passengers go through immigration and security checks. Or you might choose to make your own way to Brussels-South first. In any case, get to Brussels-South with plenty of spare time if you catch Eurostar.</li>
	<li>Systematic checks have been abolished at the international borders within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a> (Benelux, France, and West Germany were the original signatories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" target="_blank">Schengen Agreement</a> in 1985). Trains most usually run straight through the land borders between Benelux, France, and Germany. However, you could still have your ID and belongings checked by police or customs officers anywhere, including railway stations, or even inside moving trains. In special circumstances, systematic checks at the borders can be reinstated. Remember to have your passport or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area" target="_blank">EEA</a>/Swiss-issued ID card with you, and try avoiding tight connections in general.</li>
</ul>      
<p>Special trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are no longer regular long-distance night trains or autotrains in Benelux. The closest access points for international night trains are:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">ÖBB</a> (Austrian Rail)'s <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a> from Germany (Hamburg, Hannover, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Berlin, Münich). Some ÖBB Nightjet trains can take <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/ausstattung/automotorrad.html" target="_blank">cars and motorcycles</a>. ÖBB is interested in running night trains to the Netherlands, and this service might start in 2020;</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail)'s <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/intercites" target="_blank">Intercités de Nuit</a> from Paris-Austerlitz. SNCF has a separate <a href="https://www.sncf.com/sncv1/en/services/cars-motorcycles-bicycles" target="_blank">autotrain</a> service from Paris-Bercy (no passengers).</li></ul></li>
	<li>Not included in the maps are charter trains to, e.g., ski destinations in winter, music festivals in summer. (I know of <a href="https://www.treinreiswinkel.nl/reizen/wintersport-vakanties" target="_blank">Treinreiswinkel</a>, and <a href="https://festival.travel/travel/festivaltreinen/" target="_blank">Festival.Travel</a>.) All (?) of these charter trains are night trains.</li>

<p>Developments on train travels in Benelux since 10-12-2017:</p>
<ul>
	<li>01-01-2018: NRW-Tarif is now valid on RE 18 Heerlen – Herzogenrath.</li>
	<li>14-01-2018: RB 61 starts operating between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim. (In reality, replacement buses run till Sunday 25-02-2018.)</li>
	<li>12-02-2018: The station of Waddinxveen Triangel opens, on the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line.</li>
	<li>20-02-2018: Eurostar announces its London–Amsterdam schedule from 04-04-2018.</li>
	<li>23-02-2018: NS announces that the non-peak surcharge-free period for Intercity direct is extended till 08-04-2018. (During this period, there is a surcharge for Intercity direct between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal only between 06:30–09:30 and 16:00–19:00 on weekdays.)</li>
	<li>28-03-2018: The station of Eemshaven opens; Eemshaven is now the northern-most train station in the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>04-04-2018: Eurostar begins its operation in the Netherlands. However, border control in the Netherlands cannot start until at least the end of 2019; when passengers travel towards London, passengers have to disembark and go through Schengen and UK border controls in Brussels. The train towards London stops at Brussels for 1 hour 18 minutes; Eurostar usually put passengers on Thalys trains to get to Brussels.
	<li>09-04-2018: IC Amsterdam – Brussels rerouted to high-speed lines. 12 trains per day run through the Schiphol–Rotterdam high-speed line to/from Amsterdam (these are now classed as Intercity direct in the Netherlands), while 4 trains per day goes to/from Den Haag HS (these remain InterCity). Dordrecht and Roosendaal are now skipped by the IC, while Breda and Noorderkempen are added.</li>
	<li>09-04-2018: Replacement buses for P/RE trains no longer run between Gouvy and Troisvierges.</li>
	<li>26-05-2018: L train service between Roosendaal and Puurs disconnected at Essen. This lasts till late August(?).</li>
