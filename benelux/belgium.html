	      <figcaption>Train operators and their networks in Benelux</figcaption></figure></div>
<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (Dutch: <em>Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen</em>, French: <em>Société nationale des chemins de fer belges</em> 'National Company of the Belgian Railways'; <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The national railway company; runs all but a few trains in Belgium. NMBS/SNCB's own network is extended into all neighbouring countries: a little into the Netherlands, Germany, France, and all the way into Luxembourg City from two different directions.
	<ul>
		<li>The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity is run together with NS (Dutch Rail; <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). These services run on the Antwerp – Rotterdam high-speed rail line, and for the vast majority of Amsterdam services, also on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line. The ones that go through the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) in the Netherlands. this Belgium–Netherlands service is commonly referred as the 'Benelux trains'. (Despite the name, it has never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg.)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The Luxembourgish national railway company. Near the Belgian–Luxembourgish border, CFL runs trains every half or one hour everyday to Athus. (Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is also extended to Athus with CFL trains and Luxembourgish buses.) On weekdays, CFL runs a few peak services to Virton and Gouvy.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators (unless otherwise indicated, at Brussels-South they depart from platforms 3/4/5/6, where there is occasional security control, but no border control):</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (Brussels-South – Brussels-North – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne (– Cologne/Bonn Airport) – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt). ICE International is a consortium of DB (German Rail) and NS. Cross-border or domesitc travel within Germany follows German long-distance ticketing rules (i.e. dynamic pricing). If travelling domestically within Belgium (Brussels – Liège), there is an ICE surcharge (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail) (Brussels-South to Lille-Europe and many other destinations in France like Paris CDG Airport, but not the main Paris stations). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (Paris-Nord/Lille-Europe – Brussels-South – Antwerp-Centraal – Rotterdam – Schiphol – Amsterdam; Paris-Nord – Brussels-South – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne – Düsseldorf (– Düsseldorf Airport) – Duisburg – Essen (– Dortmund); seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille). The first and second shareholders are SNCF and NMBS/SNCB respectively. It has its own ticketing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a>. Low-cost service between Brussels-South and Paris-Nord by Thalys. Runs half on high-spee rail, and half on conventional rail. It has its own fare structure, and tickets can only be booked through the IZY website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (London (–Ebbsfleet) (–Ashford) (–Calais) – Lille – Brussels-South; London – Brussels-South – Rotterdam – Amsterdam). Majority owned by SNCF. It has its own ticketing. Eurostar services to the Netherlands depart from platforms 3/4/5/6. Eurostar services to France and England depart from platforms 1/2: passengers to UK depart from the main Eurostar check-in area with full border and security checks; passengers to France (Lille/Calais) go through a separate check-in terminal without border checks. Eurostar tickets from Brussels to France can only be booked through the Belgian Eurostar website, at least 2 days (?) before departure. Eurostar tickets to/from the the three stations in England cost the same; a Eurostar ticket booked from one of the three stations <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/be-en/question/I-ve-booked-from-one-station-can-I-board-at-another" target="_blank">allows you to board at the other two stations</a>. Similarly, Eurostar passengers from Continental Europe can disembark at any of the three stations in England. (But not all trains stop at Ebbsfleet or Ashford.)</li>  
	</ul>
	      <p>Very close to the Belgian border is the French station of Tourcoing (on the Kortrijk – Mouscron – Lille-Flandres InterCity line of NMBS/SNCB); Tourcoing is a terminus for <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a>, SNCF's domestic low-cost high-speed service in France. Another two OUIGO stations that are also close to the Belgian border are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV south of Luxembourg.</p>
	      <h3 id="train-types">Train types</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, trains in Belgium can be divided into high-speed and non-high-speed trains. The high-speed services are already introduced above; here are one-line summaries of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): high-speed service between Brussels and Frankfurt</li>
		<li><em>TGV</em>: high-speed services from Brussels to various destinations in France</li>
		<li><em>Thalys</em>: high-speed service to Paris/Lille, Essen/Dortmund, and Amsterdam</li>
		<li><em>IZY</em>: low-cost high-speed service between Brussels and Paris</li>
		<li><em>Eurostar</em>: high-speed service to Lille/London, and Amsterdam</li>
	</ul>
<p>As for non-high-speed services, they can be devided into regular services, and supplementary services. Regular services run every half or one or two hours. There are the following regular non-high-speed train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>S-train (Dutch: <em>S-trein</em> / <em>voorstadstrein</em>; French: <em>Train S</em> / <em>train suburbain</em>; German: <em>S-Zug</em> / <em>S-Bahn</em>): basically all-stops service in Greater Brussels region; some S-train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services). Each S-train line has a line number: on weekdays there are S1 to S10, S20, and peak service S81; on the weekend there are S1, S2, S5, S6, S8, S10, S20.</li>
	<li>L-train (Dutch: <em>L-trein</em> / <em>stoptrein</em>; French <em>Train L</em> / <em>omnibus</em>; German: <em>L-Zug</em> / <em>Nahverkehrszug</em>): basically all-stops service elsewhere in the country, including the lines to Roosendaal and Maastricht in the Netherlands, and Aachen Hbf in Germany. Some L-train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services).</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): basically only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. During the weekend, IC trains may make extra stops at some sections. The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity service is jointly operated by NMBS/SNCB and NS (Dutch Rail). (In the Netherlands, the vast majority of the Brussels – Amsterdam services run on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line, and these are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) by NS.) </li>
</ul>
<p>There used to be an intermediate category called the InterRegio (IR), but this category no longer exists in Belgium.</p>
<p>The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Belgium.</p>

</div>
<br/>
	      <p>Other than the regular trains, there are also the supplementary trains. These are irregular train services that run in addition to the regular (non-high-speed) train services listed above. They often have routing and stopping patterns that are different from the regular services.</p>
<ul>
	<li>P trains (Dutch: <em>P-trein</em> / <em>piekuurtrein</em>; French: <em>Train P</em> / <em>train d'heure de pointe</em>; German <em>P-Zug</em> / <em>Zug des Spitzenverkehrs</em>). Some are all-stops, some are like InterCity's, and many are somewhat mixed. Most P trains run on weekdays during peak time, usually in the dominant commute direction, primarily during non-holiday periods. There are also the Sunday P-trains, which are aimed at sending students back to their tertiary institution on Sunday evenings during term time.</li>
	<li>ICT trains (Dutch: <em>ICT-trein</em> / <em>toeristentrein</em>; French <em>Trein ICT</em> / <em>train touristique</em>). These are additional trains to and from popular holiday destinations, especially the coast and Walibi (theme park). Some are run on weekdays, more are run on the weekend. NMBS/SNCB can run extra ICT services to the coast if the weather is predicted to be remarkably good. The ICT services are primarily run during the holiday periods, so they are largely mutually exclusive with the P services, which are primarily run during the non-holiday periods.</li>
	      </ul>
<p>The following are network maps of the supplementary passenger rail services in Belgium. Included in the weekday P train map are the S trains that are functionally P trains.</p>

<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	<p>Mirroring the complexity of the Belgian railway network, there is a myriad of ticketing options in Belgium. Here I will only be able to introduce the most-commonly encountered ticketing issues.</p>
<h4 id="channels-of-purchase-international-tickets">Channels of purchase: international tickets</h4>
	      <p>The various channels of purchasing international tickets through NMBS/SNCB International share many similarities. The user interface of the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a> and the app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>) is basically the same: Input the desired travel details. Other than the 'from' and 'to' stations, you can also input a 'via' station. If it can compute your route, it gives you a list of possibilities. You choose one of them, it shows you the details of the journey, and ticket conditions, and then (if you agree) you can press 'book'. You then input your personal details. The payment methods are Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, PayPal, Bancontact (Belgian debit card), and iDEAL (Dutch bank transfer). If payment is successful, a ticket is issued. For most destinations, an e-ticket is delivered. See <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Delivery" target="_blank">ticket delivery methods</a>.</p>
	      <p>Some ticket offices/counters can handle international tickets. In 20+ stations, they offer the full range of international tickets. In another 20+ stations, they can only handle tickets to destination(s) directly reachable from their station (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of such stations). Other than purchasing tickets at a ticket counter, tickets can also be purchased via telephone. For ticket purchase at a ticket counter or via telephone, in many cases they charge a service fee of €5/€9/€14 (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">here</a>). Tickets purchased via telephone, or tickets purchased online that cannot be delivered as an e-ticket, can be picked up for free at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#PickupStations" target="_blank">48 Belgian stations and 6 Dutch stations</a>. (For tickets that can be issued as an e-ticket, but you choose to pick it up at a station, there is a handling fee of €6.)</p>
	      <p>Belgian ticket machines don't sell tickets to international services that are not run purely by NMBS/SNCB. And even then, there are restrictions. See <a href="#domestic-international">below</a>, including special conditions that these short-distance cross-border tickets have.</p>
	      <h4>Domestic tickets through NMBS/SNCB app</h4>
<p>From the NMBS/SNCB domestic app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): you plan a journey in the journey planner. If you press a suggested journey that is purely domestic, and involves only trains, at the bottom of the suggestion is a button which says 'buy ticket'. Check the details of the ticket: product (i.e. ticket type; see <a href="#types-of-tickets">below</a>, from, to, number of passengers (1 to 6), date, type/Class (single/return/1st class/2nd class). 'Via' is not possible with Belgian domestic tickets; breaking of journey is allowed (see <a href="#breaking-and-detour">below</a>), but if you make a detour, you have to buy two separate tickets. Pressing tick on the top right corner gets you to a confirmation screen; price is also given on the same screen. Press tick again, and you'll have to put in the personal details of the principle traveller: first name, last name, date of birth, and e-mail address. Methods of payment are Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Only credit cards are accepted. When the transaction is succesful, the ticket is stored in the app. You have to show the mobile ticket from the app in a smart phone, or tablet computer, when asked by a train conductor. The principle traveller also has to be ready to show an ID, matching the personal details of the ticket.</p>
	      <h4>Domestic and cross-border tickets through NMBS/SNCB website</h4>
	      <p>At the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB domestic website</a>, you can start by using the journey planner. After it gives you suggested itinieraries, there is a 'buy ticket' button at the bottom. (Alternatively, press <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> directly. Or try their <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new trial page</a>.) You then have to fill in journey details and personal details of the traveller. In contrast to the app, which is only for domestic journeys, the website has three extra options in the 'ticket' drop-down list: 'TICKET AACHEN', 'TICKET MAASTRICHT', and 'TICKET ROOSENDAAL' (the three stations in Maastricht area served by the NMBS/SNCB local train cost the same). The range of payment accepted are:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Card: Mastercard, Bancontact, BNP Paribas Fortis, American Express, Visa</li>
		      <li>Belgian Bank transfer: ING, Belfius, KBC, CBC</li>
	      </ul>
<p>A ticket is delivered as a pdf, which you have to print out. Alternatively, for a purely domestic ticket, (before payment) you can choose to have it recorded in the travellers Belgian national ID card electronically (you'll have to input the ID card number).</p>
	      <h4 id="domestic-international">Domestic and cross-border tickets through ticket machines and ticket counters</h4>
	      <p>There are ticket machines at all Belgian stations. You can choose from English, German, French, or Dutch language at the ticket machines. Some have ticket counters. They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., some internet-only tickets). The ticket counters at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">these stations</a> can sell international tickets. For Belgian ticket machines, the rage of international tickets that they can sell is very limited:</p>
	<ul>
	      <li>All ticket machines in Belgium can issue tickets to/from <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/aachen.aspx" target="_blank">Aachen Hbf</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/roosendaal.aspx" target="_blank">Roosendaal</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht.aspx" target="_blank">Maastricht</a> (Maastricht Randwyck and Eijsden cost the same as Maastricht). A ticket from the border to Aachen/Roosendaal/Maastricht can be used back-to-back with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train. (Clauses in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht/~/media/AD187918B2464AA3AEF121AD88E19E45.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht/~/media/1E74F893534F408194E4429D83E432FF.pdf" target="_blank"></a></li>
	      <li>Only ticket machines at some stations near the Luxembourgish border have an <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">'all stations in Luxembourg'</a> option: 
		<ul>
			      <li>Gouvy, Vielsalm, and Trois-Ponts via the Gouvy frontier</li> 
			      <li>Arlon and Messancy via the Sterpenich frontier</li>
			      <li>Arlon, Aubange, Halanzy, Virton, and Messancy via the Athus frontier</li>
		</ul>
	(Luxembourgish ticketing applies to CFL trains to/from Athus; if you are already in Athus, just get a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or the CFL train conductor.) NOTE!: these (and other) special Belgian–Luxembourgish trans-border tickets cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket! E.g., DO NOT board the IC from Luxembourg with a Luxembourg – Arlon ticket, AND then remain in the same train after Arlon and expect that you can present another Belgian domestic ticket from Arlon without drama. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Luxembourg past Arlon, or catch another train at Arlon! (Clauses in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/CD78FD0FFC1442F5B364FF4BE15AC331.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/294B6201AFD240E2A3476BD9FB237630.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.)</li>
		<li>Only ticket machines at some stations near the French border have the 'Trampoline ticket 1 day' options, for unlimited travel for 1 day the lines to <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille.aspx" target="_blank">Lille-Flandres</a>: 
		<ul>
			<li>At Kortrijk or Zone Mouscron (Mouscron or Herseaux), for the line through the Tourcoing frontier to Lille-Flandres</li>
			<li>At Tournai or Froyennes, for the line through the Blaindain frontier to Lille-Flandres</li>
		</ul>
		NOTE!: these (and other) Trampoline tickets cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket! E.g., DO NOT board the IC from Lille-Flandres with a Trampoline ticket to Kortrijk, AND then remain in the same train after Kortrijk and expect that you can present another Belgian domestic ticket from Kortrijk without drama. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Lille-Flandres past Kortrijk, or catch another train at Kortrijk!

	      <h4 id="promotional-tickets-and-tourist-tickets">Promotional tickets and 'tourist tickets'</h4>
	      <p>NS runs various promotional tickets (but you'll need Dutch reading skills). Some are sold through its own <a href="https://www.spoordeelwinkel.nl/" target="_blank">online store</a>, while others are sold in coorporation and through other physical or online stores. One place where these various deals are summarised is <a href="https://www.treinreiziger.nl/category/treinkaartjes/" target="_blank">treinreiziger.nl</a>. Ones that are sold at physical stores can be disposable OV-chipkaarts, or a code which you turn into an e-ticket on the internet (they come with instructions, in Dutch).</p>
	      <p>NS sells the following 'tourist tickets':</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/amsterdam-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam Travel Ticket</a>: €16/€21/€26 for 1/2/3 days. One return journey (?) on the train between Schiphol Airport and {the Amsterdam– stations, or Duivendrecht}, unlimited travel on GVB trams/buses/metros/ferries, and the airport express bus 397 or N97. (Cost-wise, this is comparable to GVB's own 24/48/72 hour tickets €7.5/€12.5/€17.5, plus €8.5 worth of train travelling. Check the rules carefully.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/uitleg-overige-producten/p/amsterdam-region-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Amsterdam region travel ticket</a>: €18.5/€26/€33.5 for 1/2/3 days. Valid for unlimited trips on NS trains, and buses/trams/metros/ferries run by GVB, EBS, Connexxion in the 'Amsterdam region'. (Click the map to open a larger version in another tab/window.)

	      <figcaption>Railway stations within the validity area of the Amsterdam region travel ticket (area within the red dotted loop). Only Sprinter services are shown; InterCity and Intercity direct services between stations (names in bold) within this region are also valid.</figcaption></figure></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/holland-travel-ticket" target="_blank">Holland travel ticket</a>: €39 'off-peak' (i.e. not during 06:30–09:00 weekdays), €55 whole-day. Covers all Dutch train and bus/tram/metro travel. (€39 is on the expensive side, and €55 is too-expensive; but it is convenient for tourists.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart" target="_blank">Day ticket</a>: €50.6, unlimited travel on Dutch trains for an entire day. (Too expensive. You can do much better with promotional tickets.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/overige-kaartjes/p/euregio" target="_blank">Euregio ticket</a>: €18.5, unlimited travel for one day on buses and many train lines in southern Dutch Limburg province, Belgian Limburg and Liège provinces, and Aachen region in Germany. During the weekend and holidays, it is valid for two adults and three children under 12 years old. Best if you bring the <a href="https://avv.de/de/service/downloads?file=files/avv/files/tickets/flyer/euregioticket.pdf" target="_blank">brochure</a> along, as some train conductors / bus drivers might not know what it is (speaking from experience). Check very carefully what train and bus lines are or are not covered in each province/region. In the map of the brochure: a) with trains, the blue dotted lines are railway lines that the Euregio ticket is valid on, while the grey dotted lines are lines where it is NOT valid on. In Germany, it is only valid on local trains (S-Bahn, RB, and RE). It is also not valid on Thalys, ICE, and EuroNight; b) with buses, the Euregio ticket is valid on all buses in this region (but check the range of public transport operators listed). The red lines are just some example bus lines.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h4 id="check-in-portals">Check-in portals</h4>
<p>If you hold an e-ticket, this section does not concern you; you do not need to check in or out. The barcode in your e-ticket (on a piece of paper, or in a mobile app) can be used to open closed gates at stations.</p>
	<p>For holders of OV-chipkaarts: there are two types of check-in portals: poles and gates. The check-in poles are just standing structures where you tap your card for checking in or out. On the other hand, check-in gates have barriers which, if closed, restrict access to the platforms, and only open as one checks in or out with with an OV-chipkaart. (Some stations have gates that are not closed, for at least part of the day. You still need to check in or out at these open gates.) Whether stations have gates or not is not relative to the size of a station; some very small stations have gates, while some large stations do not have gates.</p>
<p>There are four system of check-in portals: NS, Arriva, Blauwnet, and Valleilijn. When catching trains of these four companies/brands, use the corresponding check-in portals. For companies other than these four, use the non-NS ones that are present, except for these three that use NS portals: a) in the west, R-net Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn (which is run by NS), b) in the deep south, NMBS/SNCB Maastricht – Eijsden, and c) in the deep south, DB Regio Heerlen – Eygelshoven Markt. (Information in 2018; c, and perhaps b, will change in 2019.) This information is displayed in some of the maps, two of them repeated here:</p>

</div>
<br/>
<p>There are not many stations where two systems intersect; the vast majority of them are in the east of the country. There is only one station, Zutphen, where three systems intersect. You do not need to check out and then in again if you are changing between trains of the same system. If you change between two systems, there are check-in poles of each system standing next to each other on the platforms; you check out of one system, and then in with the other system.</p> 
<p>There are some stations where metro and NS trains share the same paid area behind gates, or even either sides of an island platform; you can find their respective check-in poles standing next to each other.</p> 
<p>All metro stations have OV-chipkaart ticket gates. On the other hand, with buses/trams/waterbuses, their card readers are inside the vehicle; you have to check in and out of each individual bus/tram/waterbus that you board.</p>
<h4 id="surcharges">Surcharges</h4>
      <ul>
	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a>: travellers can travel on the ICE service domestically in the Netherlands (Amsterdam Centraal – Utrecht Centraal – Arnhem Centraal) with a normal domestic ticket, plus an ICE supplement. The supplement is €2.4, and can be purchased as an e-ticket, a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart. The ICE supplement is not applicable to passengers with an NS subscription (that is valid on the section travelled on), NS-business card, student subscription, student subscription, or children passengers travelling on Railrunner or Kids Vrij. The ICE supplement is also not applicable to international ICE tickets to/from the Netherlands.</li>
	      <li><a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">ICd supplement</a>: when travelling domestically in the Netherlands, on either the domestic or international ICd service, there is an Intercity direct supplement on the high-speed rail between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal. The ICd supplement is €2.4, and it can be purchased online as an e-ticket, or from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing fee; but this option is not necessarily available in ticket machines not along the ICd route). For people with a durable OV-chipkaart, there are ICd supplement poles at Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam Centraal, and Breda, where you can tap your OV-chipkaart once before you board the train. (DO NOT tap the ICd supplement pole again after you get off the train.) This year (2018) the ICd supplement is temporarily lowered to €1.4 if it is paid by tapping an ICd supplement pole DURING OFF-PEAK. The ICd supplment is not applicable to passengers with an international ticket that goes to/from/through Belgium and covers the Schiphol–Rotterdam section.</li>
      </ul>
	<h4 id="children-seniors-bicycles-pets">Children, seniors, bicycles, and pets</h4>
	<h5>Children and seniors</h5>
	<p>0 to 3 year-olds do not need to pay; they (may, but) do not have the right to occupy a seat.</p> 
<p>Children 4 to 11 years can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket, which costs €2.5 for one day. It can be purchased as an e-ticket from the NS website, as a disposable OV-chipkaart from a ticket machine (no ticket-issuing cost), or loaded into a durable OV-chipkaart. With a Railrunner ticket, a child 4 to 11 years old: a) can travel independently in second class(!); or b) has to be accompanied by an adult 18 years or older with a valid ticket in first class; each such adult can accompany at most three children, each with their own Railrunner ticket.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for people with an NS subscription, they can get a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/kids-vrij.html" target="_blank">Kids Vrij</a> subscriptions for at most three children, each costing €0.01 a year (in 2018). The only extra cost is €7.5 if they need do not already have a personal OV-chipkaart. A child travelling on Kids Vrij has to be accompanied by a passenger 12 years or older with a valid ticket. Each such older passenger can accompany at most three children, each with their own Kids Vrij subscription.</p>
	<p>Railrunner and Kids Vrij are valid for all train travel in the Netherlands (except Thalys and Eurostar). If it is in an OV-chipkaart, check in and out as usual. Children on these do not have to pay the ICE supplement or the ICd supplement. For international travel: a) in Germany, with <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/familie/fahrkarten_fuer_kinder.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>, children under 6 do not need a ticket; older children under 15 years old can have their names be added to their parent's or grandparent's ticket, and these children travel for free; otherwise tickets for 6-14 year-olds are half the adult price; b) <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/reduction/children.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium</a>; c) <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/la-gratuit%C3%A9-de-transport/enfants" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>.</p>
	      <p>There are no special single or return tickets for students or seniors. However, there are special subscriptions for local students, and seniors get extra privilages with the usual subscriptions.</p>
	      <h5>Bicycles</h5>
	      <p>Folding bicycles that are fully folded up are treated as normal luggage, and can travel on trains for free at all times. For other bicycles, the NS bicycle ticket is valid for all Dutch railway companies. However, Arriva has better deals with some of their lines.</p>
	      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/luggage/means-of-transport-on-the-train.html" target="_blank">Nederlands Spoorwegen</a>: with a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-fiets" target="_blank"><em>dagkaart fiets</em></a> 'bicycle day-ticket' (€6.2), bicycles are allowed onboard outside peak time (06:30–09:00, 16:00–18:30) during weekdays, the whole day during weekends and holidays, and the entirety of July and August.

	      </ul>
<p>When doing your own search on the internet about bicycle transportation, words to search for are <em>fiets meenemen</em> in Dutch, <em>Fahrradmitnahme</em> in German, and <em>vélo à bord</em> or <em>voyager avec vélo</em> etc. in French.</p>
	<h5 id="pets">Pets</h5>
	<p>A smaller pet that fit in a small carry case or sit on your lap do not need a ticket. A larger pet needs a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/dagkaart-hond" target="_blank">dog ticket</a> (€3.1), valid for NS and Arriva. Clearly identifiable guide dogs and trainee guide dogs (e.g. ones showing logos of guide dog organisations) do not need a dog ticket.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-and-detour">Breaking and detours</h3>
<p>Except for non-flexible high-speed-rail tickets, breaking of journey is allowed. Feel free to stop at an intermediate point. The ticket (a disposable OV-chipkaart, or a paper ticket issued in other countries) is valid for services (on the designated route) of which the scheduled departure time, at the station where you board the train, is earlier than 04:00 the following day. Durable OV-chipkaarts needs to be checked out within six hours of the last check in, and checking in again within 35 minutes of the last check out is considered a transfer (a continuation of the same journey).</p>
<p>NS and the Leeuwarden/Groningen lines of Arriva charge fares based on 'tariff units' (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1522750534329/content/assets/ns-nl/voorwaarden-folders/2018/tariefeenheden-vz-2018-update-april.pdf" target="_blank">map (April 2018)</a>, <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/consumer-rates.html" target="_blank">rates</a>; for discounted rates, NS rounds to the nearest 10 cents, while Arriva rounds to the nearest 1 cent). Each unit is roughly 1km in distance, but some sections charge more tariff units than actual distance. 0-8 units cost the same, and the price increases with each unit unitl 200 units. Journeys within the Netherlands that are longer than 200 units are charged 200 units. Other companies/lines have tariffs based on the actual distance in km, plus a flagfall. (If one begins a journey with NS, and ends with another company, the return journey along the same route can have a different price, due to the difference in tariff rules, especially the flagfall rules.)</p>
<p>If a ticket only states a 'from' station and a 'to' station, you are meant to take the shortest route between the 'from' station and the 'to' station. Near two opposite ends of a railway loop, the tariff units are often configured so that it cost the same to travel through either side of the loop, despite slight difference in actual distance. For instance, a ticket from Amsterdam Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal, without further qualifications, allows the traveller to travel on the faster InterCity via Den Haag HS (the western route), or the slower Sprinter via Breukelen (the eastern route), despite the travel distance being not exactly the same. Both are charged 86 units on purpose (second class full fare €15.4). The new Intercity direct (ICd) travels on a much shorter route, but it also charges 86 units (plus an ICd supplement of €2.4 for the high-speed line between Schiphol and Rotterdam). Check route suggestions and price information given by the NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/ target="_blank">website</a> or app.</p>
<p>When there are track works or accidents, which affect the journey stated in your ticket, you can use your ticket as usual, and take the detour recommended by the railway companies. If you're using a durable OV-chipkaart, you are meant to check in and out as usual along your detour. Train conductors have hand-held devices which have real time information on track works and accidents.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility-issues">Accessibility issues</h3>
	<p>This is the NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-a-functional-disability" target="_blank">disability page</a>. It has information for passengers with various types of special requirements.</p>
	<p>For passengers with, e.g., visual impairment, mobility requirements, NS has a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-a-functional-disability/assistance-while-travelling.html" target="_blank">travel assistance</a> service. Many local trains are wheelchair-accessible, but, unfortunately, most faster trains aren't. Travel assistance is available at many stations; railway staff can help pre-booked passengers get on and off trains. You need to make a request at least one hour beforehand, giving them the details of your intended travel (date, time of departure, departure and arrival stations). Many conditions and procedures are changing on 5 June 2018; from that date, other than the usual telephone number of +31 30 2357822, you can make a request through the NS app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), or through <a href="ns.nl/reisassistentie">ns.nl/reisassistentie</a>.

<h3 id="german-trains-and-ticketing">German trains and ticketing</h3>
	<p>Several German rail services extend into the Netherlands. For domestic trips within the Netherlands on these trains, Dutch ticketing applies. Within Germany or for cross-border travels, German ticketing applies. (The only place where Dutch ticketing extends into Germany is the northernmost cross-border line east from Groningen into Weener and Leer in Germany.)</p>
	<p>The most important distinction in train types in Germany is that between <em>Fernverkehr</em> 'long distance transport', and <em>Nahverkehr</em> 'short distance transport', or local trains. The commonnest types of long distance trains are Intercity-Express (ICE), Intercity (IC), and EuroCity (EC). The commonest types of local trains are Interregio-Express (IRE), Regional-Express (RE), Regionalbahn (RB), and S-Bahn (S). Most usually, long-distance trains have different pricing from local trains. This is similar to France, but different to Benelux, where InterCity's have the same pricing as local trains. (Sometimes there are exceptional sections of long-distance services which have local-service pricing.)</p>
	<p>As for long-distance services, there is the Amsterdam – Frankfurt ICE service, and the Amsterdam – Berlin IC service. International travelling on these services follow German-type long-distance ticketing rules, and have dynamic pricing. (You can book these either through <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a> or <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a>.)</p>
	<p>As for local services, there are many tickets that are valid for local trains and other public transport throughout a state, or more locally at the level of a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbund</em></a> 'transport authority'. There are two German states that border the Netherlands: <em>Niedersachsen</em> 'Lower Saxony' in the north, and <em>Nordrhein-Westfalen</em> 'North Rhine-Westphalia' (NRW) to the south. As for transport authorities, the public transport in most areas in Germany are organised by transport authorities. This is a map of the German <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Karte_der_Verkehrsverb%C3%BCnde_und_Tarifverb%C3%BCnde_in_Deutschland.png" target="_blank"><em>Verkehrsverbünde</em></a> from German Wikipedia. In areas in Lower Saxony bordering the Netherlands, the transport authorities only coordinate the ticketing and operation of the buses, and not the trains (grey in the map: VEJ, bvE, VGB). In North Rhein-Westphalia, on the other hand, the four transport authorities coordinate the ticketing and operation of both the local trains, and also the U-bahn/trams/buses (yellow in the map: WT, VRR, AVV, VRS).</p>
	<p>In Lower Saxony, there is the <a href="http://www.niedersachsentarif.de/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsentarif</a>, which is a unified fare structure for the local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Breman, and some bordering regions, including Hengelo and Oldenzaal in the Netherlands with German local trains. The <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsenticket</a> costs €23/27/31/35/39 for 1/2/3/4/5 people, giving unlimited travel on local trains in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Breman, and some bordering regions for a day. In some areas (none bordering the Netherlands), U-Bahn/trams/buses are also included. There is also the <a href="https://niedersachsenticket.de/niedersachsen-ticket-plus-groningen/" target="_blank">Nierdersachsenticket plus Groningen</a>, which costs €28/33/38/43/48 for 1/2/3/4/5 perople. This has the same validity as the Niedersachsenticket, plus an extension on the Dutch Arriva line between Weener and Groningen. The validity map can be seen in the links above. In interactive map of the local trains in Lower Saxony is <a href="<a href="https://www.lnvg.de/interaktive-karte-streckennetz/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), there are four local transport authorities (<a href="https://www.westfalentarif.de/de/start/" target="_blank">WT</a>, <a href="http://www.vrr.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">VRR</a>, <a href="https://avv.de/de/startseite" target="_blank">AVV</a>, <a href="https://www.vrsinfo.de/" target="_blank">VRS</a>), each having unified ticketing for all local trains and U-Bahn/trams/buses in their areas. All the local German trains from NRW into the Netherlands are covered by their tickets, as well as some cross-border buses. (Check carefully for each bus route whether Dutch and/or German ticketing applies on which sections.) Other than the tickets of the transport authorities, there are also the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/hintergrund-nrw-tarif/der-nrw-tarif-im-ueberblick/" target="_blank">NRW-Tarif</a> tickets, which covers the local trains/U-Bahn/trams/buses of the four transport authorities. For their <em>PauschalpreisTickets</em> 'flat rate tickets' (time-based tickets that are not trajactory-restricted), they also cover the German local trains from NRW into the Netherlands, as well as some cross-border buses. The best known of these flat-rate NRW tickets are the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-single/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW Single</a> (€30.5 for 1 person for one day), and the <a href="https://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/tickets-tarife/tickets-im-nrw-tarif/fuer-einen-tag/schoenertagticket-nrw-5-personen/detail/" target="_blank">SchönerTagTicket NRW 5 Personen</a>(€45 for 5 people for one day). The validity map of NRW-Tarif for local trains is at the bottom of <a href="http://busse-und-bahnen.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumente/01_Tickets_und_Tarife/01_Tickets_im_NRW_Tarif/NRW_Tarif_A-Z/Basismedien_2018/Flyer_NRW_Regionalverkehrsplan_2018.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>: NRW-Tarif is valid on the coloured lines, including the grey lines in Germany and the Netherlands. The dotted lines are added validity of the flat-rate tickets (as opposed to the trajectory tickets). NRW-Tarif is not valid on the black lines, e.g. RB 61 between Hengelo and Rheine, the Belgian local train line from Aachen Hbf.</p>

<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Belgium laid the first railway in Continental Europe in 1835 (Netherlands laid its first in 1839, and Luxembourg in 1845). The three countries have well developed railway networks, connecting the vast majority of towns and cities. Within Benelux, rail is the fastest – and certainly the most convenient – way to travel between many larger city centres.</p>
<p>Press the menu buttons for tips on train travel specific to each country, including videos. Below are all the network maps that I have drawn for the regular passenger train services in Benelux in 2018. (They are repeated in the country-specific pages, with further comments.) Due to the complexity of the networks, especially that of Belgium, I have opted to not present everything in one map. The differences in the weekdays vs weekend services is very noticeable in Belgium, and less so in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. (Click on the thumbnails to open the pdf's.)</p>

<p>The following are some notes on train travel in Benelux in general (see also the country-specific pages!):</p> 
<p>Ticketing matters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The national railway companies are: 
	<ul>
		<li>Netherlands: NS (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Belgium: NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Luxembourg: CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	There is more than one company running trains in each country. The domestic websites/apps of the national railway companies can handle tickets for all regular domestic train journeys, even ones that are not run by them. The international websites/apps can handle tickets to most destinations elsewhere in Benelux, many destinations in France and Germany, and some major destinations further afield. For international journeys, the price given by different companies can be slightly different. (See the individual country pages for comments on their ticket machines.) Bordering Benelux are France and Germany. If you are going to/from/through France or Germany, you may also want to check with their national railway companies for, e.g., price, range of international tickets/destinations:
	<ul>
		<li>France: SNCF (<a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sncf.fusion" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/oui-sncf-voyages-en-train/id343889987?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Germany: DB (<a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, to buy a ticket, just input details like the 'from' and 'to' stations, the date, single/return, and class of travel (first vs second class). No need to buy separate tickets if change of train/company is needed. The train companies also sell tickets to certain locations that are not railway stations, e.g. secondary airports; these tickets combine travelling on trains and connecting buses/trams/metros. If you want to make a detour between your 'from' and 'to' locations, there is also a 'via' option in the ticket machine/website/app. The exception to this is for domestic travel in Belgium: you have to buy two separate tickets if you make a detour. (Unless if your origin/destination is in a 'Zone'; see the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page. See also the <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> and <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> pages on how their national railway companies handle passengers breaking journeys and making detours differently.) Luxembourg has a time-based fare structure for the entire country; see below and the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg</a> page.</li>
	<li>Some trains have <em>dynamic pricing</em>, especially the high-speed trains. Basically this means that the earlier you book a ticket, the better price you get. Tickets for <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv" target="_blank">TGV</a> of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (France – <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv-france-brussels" target="_blank">Brussels</a>/Luxembourg), <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (England – France – Belgium, London – Brussels – Rotterdam – Amsterdam) and <a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (France – Belgium – Netherlands/Germany) have dynamic pricing, and seat reservation is compulsory. (Seat reservation is already included in an ordinary TGV/Eurostar/Thalys ticket; you'll have to make your own reservation if you're using a Eurail/Interrail pass.) For tickets that <em>include sectors in Germany</em>, <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/trains/long-distance/ice-ice-sprinter.shtml" target="_blank">ICE</a> of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a> (Netherlands/Belgium – Germany) and InterCity (e.g. <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin" target="_blank">Amsterdam – Berlin</a>) also have dynamic pricing, but seat reservation is optional. (Cheaper tickets for ICE/InterCity/EuroCity in Germany restrict the traveller to specific trains, while full-fare tickets give flexibility.) <a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a> (Brussels – Paris) and <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">Ouigo</a> (France domestic) are lost-cost high-speed rail services; they are basically train-versions of budget airlines. (The closest Ouigo stops from Belgium and Luxembourg: <em>Tourcoing</em> near Lille (France) / Mouscron (Wallonia) / Kortrijk (Flanders); <em>Metz-Ville</em> or <em>Lorraine TGV</em> south of Luxembourg.)</li>
	<li>Other trains have <em>fixed pricing</em>. The number of tickets on sale is unlimited, and there is no seat reservation. In Benelux, InterCity and local trains of the same company have the same pricing structure (unlike Germany and France where InterCity and local trains are priced differently). 
	<ul>	
		<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, you can use any train(s) (which do not require seat reservation) along the route indicated on the ticket, throughout the day, for a single/return journey. (However, there could be a surcharge; see below.) The base fare of a return ticket is just two times the price of a single ticket. In some cases there is a separate ticket-issuing cost, which means that a return ticket can be marginally cheaper than two single tickets.</li> 
		<li>In the Netherlands, there are some trajectories where more than one company runs trains; if there is a price difference, which there usually is, when you buy a ticket the machine/website/app will show you the price difference, and ask you to specify which company's train(s) you will catch. There is also a third option which allows you to take either option.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, there is a time-based fare structure covering nearly all modes of public transport within the country: CFL trains, foreign trains with domestic sections in Luxembourg, Luxembourgish buses, and Luxtram. There is a 2-hour ticket, and a day ticket. For buses, there are similar tickets for Luxembourgish buses that travels across the border. For trains, there are also special return tickets to some closest-by international destinations. (See also the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg page</a>.)</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li>For non-high-speed train travels between the Netherlands and Belgium, NS and NMBS/SNCB offer a fixed-rate discount for tickets bought seven or more days in advance from their international websites (<a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a>) or apps (see above). The discount is larger for journeys on Monday to Thursday. There is no seat reservation, and you can use any train during the day along the designated route, crossing a specific frontier point. The number of tickets is limitless; the discounted price remain the same seven or more days in advance (i.e. there is no need to book a lot earlier than seven days ahead), while the normal full-flex price remain the same throughout. The discounted tickets are less-flexible (for changes and cancellation) than the normal full-flex tickets. <em>No discount is given by the ticket machines!</em> (This cross-border discount is not applicable to journeys between just Roosendaal and Belgium, or between just Maastricht and Belgium, as these are operated solely by NMBS/SNCB. The old day-return and weekend-return tickets between the Netherlands and Belgium were scrapped on 9th April 2018.)</li>
	<li>Between the Netherlands and Luxembourg: if going through Belgium, then the aforementioned Belgian-Dutch rules apply; if going through Germany, you'll likely go on ICE/IC, and German dynamic pricing applies. Going through Belgium is probaly faster and cheaper. But if you have to book tickets within seven days, it is also worth looking into going through Germany instead of Belgium. This is especially the case for Dutch cities like Arnhem and Venlo close to the German border. Even to/from Amsterdam it could be (marginally?) cheaper going through Germany (but the cheapest German tickets have no flexibility).</li>
	<li>Surcharges (no seat reservation is possible for these):
	<ul>
		<li>For the Amsterdam–Berlin InterCity service, domestic travel within the Netherlands on this service is just like any other domestic InterCity services, and there is no surcharge.</li>
		<li>For ICE, domestic travel within the Netherlands requires normal domestic ticketing plus an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases this surcharge is waived). For domestic travel on the ICE within Belgium, the surcharge is €8 for second class, and €12 for first class (tickets sold at international ticket counters).
		<li>For Intercity direct, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases discounted) for the high-speed rail line between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal in the Netherlands. This surcharge is not applicable to tickets to/from/through Belgium and through Schiphol – Rotterdam.</li>
		<li>The station of Brussels Airport-Zaventem has a station access fee (the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">Diabolo fee</a>) of €5.30, for each passenger passing through the ticket gates each time. (See <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/tickets/diabolo-fee-to-airport/no-diabolo.aspx" target="_blank">who</a> are exempt.)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There are the <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en" target="_blank">Interrail</a> and <a href="https://www.eurail.com/en" target="_blank">Eurail</a> rail passes. (Interrail is the cheaper option available to European citizens and residents; see <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en/help/ordering-pass/do-i-need-interrail-or-eurail-pass" target="_blank">here</a> for eligibility for Interrail vs. Eurail.) These rail passes are not the best value (for people with simple itineraries at least), but give huge flexibility. Interrail/Eurail treats Benelux as one country for their rail passes. A one-country Benelux pass can be used by residents outside Benelux. Just for comparison, with a sample intinerary of Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam on three separate days, catching only Intercity direct and InterCity (i.e. no seat reservations):
	<ul>
		<li>Interrail adult second class Benelux one-country pass, three days in a month: €121 (or €40.33 per day).</li> 
		<li>Buying individual tickets online, for travelling within the next few days, second class full fare: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €46.8, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €70. Total = €160.4.</li>
		<li>For travelling a week later, purchased online: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €25/€33, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €38/€48. Total = €106.6 (all journeys on Mon-Thurs)/ €124.6 (all journeys on Fri-Sun).
		</ul></li>
	<li>RailPlus gives 15 percent off <em>full-fare tickets</em> for international train travel between many European countries, <em>on trains without compulsory reservation</em>. Given that this is a discount off full-fare tickets, and the discount is now only 15% (it used to be 25% before 2018), in a lot of cases it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. Using the same Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam trip as an example, it costs a traveller with a Dutch <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/dal-voordeel.html" target="_blank"><em>Dal Voordeel</em></a> subscription (40%-off off-peak within the Netherlands) plus RailPlus (15% off in Belgium and Luxembourg when crossing borders), travelling off-peak second class: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €33.2, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €37.2, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €52.9. Total = €123.3.
	<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, you need to have an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">anuual subscription</a> first; then a RailPlus card cost €15.</li>
		<li>In <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Railplus" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/railplus/railplus" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>, a RailPlus card costs €50, or €25 for 0-25/60+ year-olds.</li>
		<li>In Germany, RailPlus is included in a DB <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/vorteile/railplus.shtml" target="_blank">BahnCard</a> subscription.</li>
		<li>In France, SNCF gives 25% discount for travels to Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg (and also Spain for youths) with their <a href="https://www.oui.sncf/promotion-train/multi/europe/carte-abonnement" target="_blank"><em>cartes</em></a>. It says <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/RailPlus" target="_blank">here</a> (information is not necessarily up to date) that RailPlus is not valid in France for 26-59 year-olds.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>For people making multiple long-ish trips in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB has a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/now-and-then/rail-pass.aspx" target="_blank">Rail Pass</a> for 10 trips in a year between any stations in Belgium for €77 (second class) (see also the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page). The pass can be purchased by anyone, and it can be used by multiple people travelling together. For the same Brussels &#62; Luxembourg one way journey (normal price €43.6, second class), the Brussels &#62; Arlon domestic leg cost €7.7 with this NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, and the Arlon &#62; Luxembourg international leg costs €10.5. You can remain in the train throughout; you just need to fill the details of your Brussels &#62; Arlon journey in the NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, and have pre-purchased the Arlon &#62; Luxembourg international ticket. (On non-holiday weekdays there are trains from Arlon south to Athus; for railway travel, Athus is the only station in Belgium that Luxembourg extends domestic pricing to, so the whole Brussels &#62; Athus &#62; Luxembourg one-way journey costs €7.7 plus €2~€3. It takes more time though.) People younger than 26 years old get even better deals from NMBS/SNCB.</li>
	<li>People residing outside Europe (including Turkey and Russia) can purchase a <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/passes/german-rail-pass.shtml" target="_blank">German Rail Pass</a>. In Benelux, it covers the Brussels – Liège – Aachen – Cologne <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE</a> line, and the <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/bus/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB IC Bus</a> lines to Belgium and the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>If you do not have a valid ticket before you board a train (there are no ticket machines inside trains):
		<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/deferred-payments.html" target="_blank">fine of €50</a>, which is the same for all Dutch railway companies. And you also have to buy a ticket from them.</li>
		<li>In Belgium, you can go to the train conductor (attendent) and buy a ticket. (DO NOT wait till the train conductor comes to you.) However, there is a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">surcharge of €7</a> for all journeys that begin in Belgium (i.e. the surcharge is not applicable if you join a Belgian local/IC train in a neighbouring country). See also their <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/boordtarief.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. If you fail to buy a ticket, the fine is €75.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">tickets</a> can be bought from a train conductor with a €1 surcharge per ticket. You can buy a 2-hour-ticket or 1-day-ticket from the conductor. If you are caught without a valid ticket in a train/bus/tram in Luxembourg, the fine is €150.</li></ul>
Playing dumb tourist basically never works. Train conductors are authorised to check your ID and issue you a fine. If all the ticket machines don't work and there is no other way of purchasing a ticket at a station, theoratically this information will show up in the train conductors' hand-held devices, and you'll avoid a surcharge/fine in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is also not difficult to purchase a ticket via the apps of the railway companies (familiarise yourself with the apps before getting to a station). If you lose your ticket (e.g. if your belongings are stolen), go and seek help from a train conductor, and you will not be fined if they are satisfied that your case is genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other matters concerning travelling on regular trains:</p>
<ul>	      
	<li>Like other European countries, trains that do not have compulsory seat reservation have two classes of travel/tickets: first class and second class. You can tell which carriages/ which section of a carriage is first or second class by a big number 1 or 2 next to the doors, and the difference in the colour of the seats. Long distance train carriages have two sets of exterior doors, one near each end of the carriage. In the Netherlands, a first class section is usually just between the front and back doors, or sometimes half the length of that, with the first class section separated from the rest by glass doors. In Belgium, however, the first class section can be the entire carriage, including the seats that are further forward than the front doors/ further backward than the back doors. Check the colour of the seats carefully.</li> 
	<li>In some smaller trains, the first class seats are just a few seats at the very front or very back of the train, with or without a glass door separating those from the rest of the carriage. Some smaller trains have no first class seats.</li> 
	<li>Having a ticket, either first class or second class, does not guarentee a seat. With a second class ticket, you can walk through a first class section to get to another second class section, but you are theortically not allowed to travel while standing in a first class section, not even when the second class sections are packed full of standing passengers. (This is the case with the Netherlands; I assume this is also the case with Belgium and Luxembourg. If in doubt, ask.)</li>
	<li>If you have a high-speed rail ticket, do not assume that you can automatically catch a slower train over the same trajectory if, e.g., you miss your designated high-speed train. For instance, if you have a Thalys or Eurostar ticket from Amsterdam to Brussels or further, DO NOT assume that you can therefore catch the slower Intercity direct to get to Brussels. After all, 1) a cheap Thalys/Eurostar Amsterdam–Brussels ticket is cheaper than the full-fare Intercity direct ticket that you have to buy on the spot; and 2) Dutch Rail does not have shares in Thalys or Eurostar. Similarly, ICE in Belgium is run by Dutch Rail and German Rail; if you have an ICE ticket from Brussels to Germany, DO NOT assume that you can use that ticket to catch a Belgian train to Liège and spend some time there before heading to Germany. If you miss your high-speed train, ask railway staff, they might be able to help you (e.g. your ticket might actually be flexible enough to allow changes even after the departure time). If it is the railway company's fault that you miss your train connection, they should be able to help you. (But don't count on them helping you if you miss your last possible connection. Accidents can happen; it is best to avoid having to rely on the last possible connection, or even the last few possible connections.)</li>
	<li>At major train stations there could be security checks before one boards a train, especially with high-speed trains in <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Journey#SecurityChecks" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and France. Check the websites of the high-speed rail companies for security check arrangements. Arrive at the station/platform with ample time to spare.</li>
	<li>For Eurostar passengers going from Brussels to England, there is a <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/be-en/travel-info/your-trip/check-in" target="_blank">check-in procedure</a>, full-scale security check, Schengen immigration check, and UK immigration check at Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi ("Brussels-South"). (Customs check is conducted at arrival in UK. For Eurostar passengers going to just France, there is a separate check-in terminal at Brussels-South.) The Dutch and British governments have not yet come to agreement on British immigration and security arrangements at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal, so for journeys from the Netherlands to London, Eurostar put customers on Thalys or Eurostar trains to get to Brussels-South first, where passengers go through immigration and security checks. Or you might choose to make your own way to Brussels-South first. In any case, get to Brussels-South with plenty of spare time if you catch Eurostar.</li>
	<li>Systematic checks have been abolished at the international borders within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a> (Benelux, France, and West Germany were the original signatories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" target="_blank">Schengen Agreement</a> in 1985). Trains most usually run straight through the land borders between Benelux, France, and Germany. However, you could still have your ID and belongings checked by police or customs officers anywhere, including railway stations, or even inside moving trains. In special circumstances, systematic checks at the borders can be reinstated. Remember to have your passport or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area" target="_blank">EEA</a>/Swiss-issued ID card with you, and try avoiding tight connections in general.</li>
</ul>      
<p>Special trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are no longer regular long-distance night trains or autotrains in Benelux. The closest access points for international night trains are:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">ÖBB</a> (Austrian Rail)'s <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a> from Germany (Hamburg, Hannover, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Berlin, Münich). Some ÖBB Nightjet trains can take <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/ausstattung/automotorrad.html" target="_blank">cars and motorcycles</a>. ÖBB is interested in running night trains to the Netherlands, and this service might start in 2020;</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail)'s <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/intercites" target="_blank">Intercités de Nuit</a> from Paris-Austerlitz. SNCF has a separate <a href="https://www.sncf.com/sncv1/en/services/cars-motorcycles-bicycles" target="_blank">autotrain</a> service from Paris-Bercy (no passengers).</li></ul></li>
	<li>Not included in the maps are charter trains to, e.g., ski destinations in winter, music festivals in summer. (I know of <a href="https://www.treinreiswinkel.nl/reizen/wintersport-vakanties" target="_blank">Treinreiswinkel</a>, and <a href="https://festival.travel/travel/festivaltreinen/" target="_blank">Festival.Travel</a>.) All (?) of these charter trains are night trains.</li>

<p>Developments on train travels in Benelux since 10-12-2017:</p>
<ul>
	<li>01-01-2018: NRW-Tarif is now valid on RE 18 Heerlen – Herzogenrath.</li>
	<li>14-01-2018: RB 61 starts operating between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim. (In reality, replacement buses run till Sunday 25-02-2018.)</li>
	<li>12-02-2018: The station of Waddinxveen Triangel opens, on the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line.</li>
	<li>20-02-2018: Eurostar announces its London–Amsterdam schedule from 04-04-2018.</li>
	<li>23-02-2018: NS announces that the non-peak surcharge-free period for Intercity direct is extended till 08-04-2018. (During this period, there is a surcharge for Intercity direct between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal only between 06:30–09:30 and 16:00–19:00 on weekdays.)</li>
	<li>28-03-2018: The station of Eemshaven opens; Eemshaven is now the northern-most train station in the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>04-04-2018: Eurostar begins its operation in the Netherlands. However, border control in the Netherlands cannot start until at least the end of 2019; when passengers travel towards London, passengers have to disembark and go through Schengen and UK border controls in Brussels. The train towards London stops at Brussels for 1 hour 18 minutes; Eurostar usually put passengers on Thalys trains to get to Brussels.
	<li>09-04-2018: IC Amsterdam – Brussels rerouted to high-speed lines. 12 trains per day run through the Schiphol–Rotterdam high-speed line to/from Amsterdam (these are now classed as Intercity direct in the Netherlands), while 4 trains per day goes to/from Den Haag HS (these remain InterCity). Dordrecht and Roosendaal are now skipped by the IC, while Breda and Noorderkempen are added.</li>
	<li>09-04-2018: Replacement buses for P/RE trains no longer run between Gouvy and Troisvierges.</li>
	<li>26-05-2018: L train service between Roosendaal and Puurs disconnected at Essen. This lasts till late August(?).</li>
