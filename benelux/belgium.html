<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Belgium. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about Belgium in that page are repeated here.</p>  
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Belgium. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Belgium (plus the Netherlands and Luxembourg).</p>

	      <figcaption>Train operators and their networks in Benelux</figcaption></figure></div>
<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed and semi-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (Dutch: <em>Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen</em>, French: <em>Société nationale des chemins de fer belges</em> 'National Company of the Belgian Railways'; <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The national railway company; runs all but a few trains in Belgium. NMBS/SNCB's own network is extended into all neighbouring countries: a little into the Netherlands, Germany, France, and all the way into Luxembourg City from two different directions.
	<ul>
		<li>The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity is run together with NS (Dutch Rail; <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). These services run on the Antwerp – Rotterdam high-speed rail line, and for the vast majority of Amsterdam services, also on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line. The ones that go through the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) in the Netherlands. this Belgium–Netherlands service is commonly referred as the 'Benelux trains'. (Despite the name, it has never been extended beyond Brussels to Luxembourg.)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>). The Luxembourgish national railway company. Near the Belgian–Luxembourgish border, CFL runs trains every half or one hour everyday to Athus. (Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is also extended to Athus with CFL trains and Luxembourgish buses.) On weekdays, CFL runs a few peak services to Virton and Gouvy.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators (unless otherwise indicated, at Brussels-South they depart from platforms 3/4/5/6, where there is occasional security control, but no border control):</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE International</a> (Brussels-South – Brussels-North – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne (– Cologne/Bonn Airport) – Frankfurt Airport – Frankfurt). ICE International is a consortium of DB (German Rail) and NS. Cross-border or domesitc travel within Germany follows German long-distance ticketing rules (i.e. dynamic pricing). If travelling domestically within Belgium (Brussels – Liège), there is an ICE surcharge (see <a href="#surcharges">below</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail) (Brussels-South to Lille-Europe and many other destinations in France like Paris CDG Airport, but not the main Paris stations). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thalys.com/nl/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (Paris-Nord/Lille-Europe – Brussels-South – Antwerp-Centraal – Rotterdam – Schiphol – Amsterdam; Paris-Nord – Brussels-South – Liège-Guillemins – Aachen – Cologne – Düsseldorf (– Düsseldorf Airport) – Duisburg – Essen (– Dortmund); seasonal trains to Bourg Saint-Maurice or Marseille). The first and second shareholders are SNCF and NMBS/SNCB respectively. It has its own ticketing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a>. Low-cost service between Brussels-South and Paris-Nord by Thalys. Runs half on high-spee rail, and half on conventional rail. It has its own fare structure, and tickets can only be booked through the IZY website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (London (–Ebbsfleet) (–Ashford) (–Calais) – Lille – Brussels-South; London – Brussels-South – Rotterdam – Amsterdam). Majority owned by SNCF. It has its own ticketing. Eurostar services to the Netherlands depart from platforms 3/4/5/6. Eurostar services to France and England depart from platforms 1/2: passengers to UK depart from the main Eurostar check-in area with full border and security checks; passengers to France (Lille/Calais) go through a separate check-in terminal without border checks. Eurostar tickets from Brussels to France can only be booked through the Belgian Eurostar website, at least 2 days (?) before departure. Eurostar tickets to/from the the three stations in England cost the same; a Eurostar ticket booked from one of the three stations <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/be-en/question/I-ve-booked-from-one-station-can-I-board-at-another" target="_blank">allows you to board at the other two stations</a>. Similarly, Eurostar passengers from Continental Europe can disembark at any of the three stations in England. (But not all trains stop at Ebbsfleet or Ashford.)</li>  
	</ul>
	      <p>Very close to the Belgian border is the French station of Tourcoing (on the Kortrijk – Mouscron – Lille-Flandres InterCity line of NMBS/SNCB); Tourcoing is a terminus for <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a>, SNCF's domestic low-cost high-speed service in France. Another two OUIGO stations that are also close to the Belgian border are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV south of Luxembourg.</p>
	      <h3 id="train-types">Train types</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patterns, trains in Belgium can be divided into high-speed and non-high-speed trains. The high-speed services are already introduced above; here are one-line summaries of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>ICE</em> (Intercity-Express): high-speed service between Brussels and Frankfurt</li>
		<li><em>TGV</em>: high-speed services from Brussels to various destinations in France</li>
		<li><em>Thalys</em>: high-speed service to Paris/Lille, Essen/Dortmund, and Amsterdam</li>
		<li><em>IZY</em>: low-cost high-speed service between Brussels and Paris</li>
		<li><em>Eurostar</em>: high-speed service to Lille/London, and Amsterdam</li>
	</ul>
<p>As for non-high-speed services, they can be devided into regular services, and supplementary services. Regular services run every half or one or two hours. There are the following regular non-high-speed train services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>S-train (Dutch: <em>S-trein</em> / <em>voorstadstrein</em>; French: <em>Train S</em> / <em>train suburbain</em>; German: <em>S-Zug</em> / <em>S-Bahn</em>): basically all-stops service in Greater Brussels region; some S-train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services). Each S-train line has a line number: on weekdays there are S1 to S10, S20, and peak service S81; on the weekend there are S1, S2, S5, S6, S8, S10, S20.</li>
	<li>L-train (Dutch: <em>L-trein</em> / <em>stoptrein</em>; French <em>Train L</em> / <em>omnibus</em>; German: <em>L-Zug</em> / <em>Nahverkehrszug</em>): basically all-stops service elsewhere in the country, including the lines to Roosendaal and Maastricht in the Netherlands, and Aachen Hbf in Germany. Some L-train services skip one or two stations along the way (as part of their normal services).</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): basically only stops at major stations. On certain sections it can become an all-stops service, especially towards the end of the line. During the weekend, IC trains may make extra stops at some sections. The Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague InterCity service is jointly operated by NMBS/SNCB and NS (Dutch Rail). (In the Netherlands, the vast majority of the Brussels – Amsterdam services run on the Rotterdam – Schiphol high-speed rail line, and these are classed as Intercity direct (ICd) by NS.) </li>
</ul>
<p>There used to be an intermediate category called the InterRegio (IR), but this category no longer exists in Belgium.</p>
<p>The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Belgium.</p>

</div>
<br/>
	      <p>Other than the regular trains, there are also the supplementary trains. These are irregular train services that run in addition to the regular (non-high-speed) train services listed above. They often have routing and stopping patterns that are different from the regular services.</p>
<ul>
	<li>P trains (Dutch: <em>P-trein</em> / <em>piekuurtrein</em>; French: <em>Train P</em> / <em>train d'heure de pointe</em>; German <em>P-Zug</em> / <em>Zug des Spitzenverkehrs</em>). Some are all-stops, some are like InterCity's, and many are somewhat mixed. Most P trains run on weekdays during peak time, usually in the dominant commute direction, primarily during non-holiday periods. There are also the Sunday P-trains, which are aimed at sending students back to their tertiary institution on Sunday evenings during term time.</li>
	<li>ICT trains (Dutch: <em>ICT-trein</em> / <em>toeristentrein</em>; French <em>Trein ICT</em> / <em>train touristique</em>). These are additional trains to and from popular holiday destinations, especially the coast and Walibi (theme park). Some are run on weekdays, more are run on the weekend. NMBS/SNCB can run extra ICT services to the coast if the weather is predicted to be remarkably good. The ICT services are primarily run during the holiday periods, so they are largely mutually exclusive with the P services, which are primarily run during the non-holiday periods.</li>
	      </ul>
<p>The following are network maps of the supplementary passenger rail services in Belgium. Included in the weekday P train map are the S trains that are functionally P trains.</p>

<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	<p>Mirroring the complexity of the Belgian railway network, there is a myriad of ticketing options in Belgium. Here I will only be able to introduce the most-commonly encountered ticketing issues.</p>
	      <h4 id="channels-of-purchase">Channels of purchase</h4> 
	      <h5>International tickets</h4>
	      <p>The various channels of purchasing international tickets through NMBS/SNCB International share many similarities. The user interface of the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a> and the app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>) is basically the same: Input the desired travel details. Other than the 'from' and 'to' stations, you can also input a 'via' station. If it can compute your route, it gives you a list of possibilities. You choose one of them, it shows you the details of the journey, and ticket conditions, and then (if you agree) you can press 'book'. You then input your personal details. The payment methods are Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, PayPal, Bancontact (Belgian debit card), and iDEAL (Dutch bank transfer). If payment is successful, a ticket is issued. For most destinations, an e-ticket is delivered. See <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Delivery" target="_blank">ticket delivery methods</a>.</p>
	      <p>Some ticket offices/counters can handle international tickets. In 20+ stations, they offer the full range of international tickets. In another 20+ stations, they can only handle tickets to destination(s) directly reachable from their station (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of such stations). Other than purchasing tickets at a ticket counter, tickets can also be purchased via telephone. For ticket purchase at a ticket counter or via telephone, in many cases they charge a service fee of €5/€9/€14 (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">here</a>). Tickets purchased via telephone, or tickets purchased online that cannot be delivered as an e-ticket, can be picked up for free at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#PickupStations" target="_blank">48 Belgian stations and 6 Dutch stations</a>. (For tickets that can be issued as an e-ticket, but you choose to pick it up at a station, there is a handling fee of €6.)</p>
	      <p>Belgian ticket machines don't sell tickets to international services that are not run purely by NMBS/SNCB. And even then, there are restrictions. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a>, including special conditions that these short-distance cross-border tickets have.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic tickets through NMBS/SNCB app</h5>
<p>From the NMBS/SNCB domestic app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): you plan a journey in the journey planner. If you press a suggested journey that is purely domestic, and involves only trains, at the bottom of the suggestion is a button which says 'buy ticket'. Check the details of the ticket: product (i.e. ticket type; see <a href="#types-of-tickets">below</a>, from, to, number of passengers (1 to 6), date, type/Class (single/return/1st class/2nd class). 'Via' is not possible with Belgian domestic tickets; breaking of journey is allowed (see <a href="#breaking-and-detour">below</a>), but if you make a detour, you have to buy two separate tickets. Pressing tick on the top right corner gets you to a confirmation screen; price is also given on the same screen. Press tick again, and you'll have to put in the personal details of the principle traveller: first name, last name, date of birth, and e-mail address. Methods of payment are Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Only credit cards are accepted. When the transaction is succesful, the ticket is stored in the app. You have to show the mobile ticket from the app in a smart phone, or tablet computer, when asked by a train conductor. The principle traveller also has to be ready to show an ID, matching the personal details of the ticket.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets through NMBS/SNCB website</h5>
	      <p>At the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB domestic website</a>, you can start by using the journey planner. After it gives you suggested itinieraries, there is a 'buy ticket' button at the bottom. (Alternatively, press <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> directly. Or try their <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new trial page</a>.) You then have to fill in journey details and personal details of the traveller. In contrast to the app, which is only for domestic journeys, the website has three extra options in the 'ticket' drop-down list: 'TICKET AACHEN', 'TICKET MAASTRICHT', and 'TICKET ROOSENDAAL' (the three stations in Maastricht area served by the NMBS/SNCB local train cost the same). The range of payment accepted are:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Card: Mastercard, Bancontact, BNP Paribas Fortis, American Express, Visa</li>
		      <li>Belgian Bank transfer: ING, Belfius, KBC, CBC</li>
	      </ul>
<p>A ticket is delivered as a pdf, which you have to print out. Alternatively, for a purely domestic ticket, (before payment) you can choose to have it recorded in the travellers Belgian national ID card electronically (you'll have to input the ID card number).</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets through ticket machines and ticket counters</h5>
	      <p>There are ticket machines at all Belgian stations. In the Netherlands and Germany, they are found in Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Aachen Hauptbahnhof (but apparently not in Eijsden). You can choose from English, German, French, or Dutch language at the ticket machines. They take Visa, Bancontact (Belgian cards), MasterCard, Maestro, and American Express. Some also take coins.</p>
	      </p>They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., some internet-only tickets). The rage of international tickets that they sell is very limited: tickets to Aachen Hbf, Roosendaal, or Maastricht on NMBS/SNCB trains can be bought from any ticket machines in Belgium; tickets for Lille on NMBS/SNCB trains, and 'anywhere in Luxembourg' tickets, can only be bought in their respective border regions. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a> on the conditions of these tickets. The Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands and Germany have a somewhat restricted range of tickets on offer. For instance, the NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, which is not valid outside Belgium, is apparently not sold there.</a>	      
	  <p>Some stations have ticket counters. They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., some internet-only tickets). The ticket counters at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">these stations</a> can sell international tickets. They may charge a ticket-issuing fee (see the preceding link).</p>
	      <h5>Tickets purchased on board from NMBS/SNCB conductors, and FINES</h5>
	      <p>Buying tickets on board NMBS/SNCB trains incurs a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">fee of €7</a>, unless:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>you buy your ticket onboard an NMBS/SNCB train while it is not in Belgium. (Not including the Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague IC; if you don't have a ticket, you will probably get a Dutch fine of €50.)</li>
		      <li>you buy a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">diabolo fee</a> (Brussels Airport-Zaventem station access fee; €5.3)</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>See also other exemptions in their <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/boordtarief.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
	      <p>Go to a train conductor before they come to you. If you fail to buy a ticket on board, you will get a fine of €75 in Belgium. (I don't know what rule applies if you're in an NMBS/SNCB train a in neighbouring country. For instance, the usual Luxembourgish fine is €150.)</p>
	      <p>The ticket that you get from a train conductor is an <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/ticket-on-the-train.aspx" target="_blank">RFID ticket</a> (contactless). If you need recept, or otherwise need to read the data of an RFID ticket issued to you, you can tap that ticket on the card reader at a ticket machine. An RFID ticket cannot be used to travel from Belgium to neighbouring countries.</p>
	      <h4 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets</h4>
	      <p>There is a plethora of ticket types sold by NMBS/SNCB for domestic and short-distance cross-border journeys. (Things are complicated, but it is because there are many good deals.) Here I will only introduce some more common ones for domestic trips.</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/one-time/standard-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Standard Ticket</a> (Standaardbiljet/Billet Standard/Standardfahrkarte): full fare single/return tickets</li>
		      <li><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/one-time/weekend-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Weekend Ticket</a> (Weekendbiljet/Billet Week-end/Wochenendfahrkarte): return journey for basically the same price as a normal one-way Standard Ticket. Valid on Friday from 19:00, and the whole day on Saturday and Sunday; the return journey can occur anytime during the same weekend period. Also valid on certain other days.</p>

A bicycle ticket is not valid (i.e. bicycles are not allowed) at the stations of Brussels-Central, Brussels-Chapelle/-Kapellekerk, Brussels-Congres, and on the NMBS/SNCB Libramont – Bastogne bus.

	<h4>Summary of purchase channels/ ticket types</h4>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB provides this <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/where-to-buy-my-tickets/buy-summary.aspx" target="_blank">summary table</a> for the various channels of purchase and types of tickets.</p>
	<h3 id="breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">Breaking, detours, zones, and fares</h3>
	<p>By default, you travel on the shortest possible route in distance between the 'from' and the 'to' stations. In this case, you are allowed to break your journey: feel free to stop at an intermediate point, and rejoin the journey later. The ticket is valid until the last service of the day (you are responsible for checking whether there are still services that allow you to complete the journey).</p>
	<p>In some cases, you can also take a route that is not shortest in distance. However, in these circumstances, you are not allowed to break your journey (changing trains is in most cases allowed):</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you can get to your destination faster;</li>
	<li>if you can avoid changing trains, and stay in the same train, and if this journey is maximally 30 minutes longer than taking the shortest route in distance;</li>
	<li>you can backtrack along a route if by doing that, you can get to your destination faster, or if there is no connection right at where the two tracks intersect, or if there is a delay.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Otherwise, if you want to make a detour, you have to purchase two spearate tickets. In the NMBS/SNCB journey planner, sometimes it gives you suggestions with a warning saying that you have to buy two separate tickets for the suggested journey.</p>
	<p id="Zone">Some stations are grouped together into 'Zones'. There are 21 such Zones in Belgium; the largest of which is the Brussels Zone, covering basically the same area as the Brussels-Capital Region. These zones are indicated in the maps above as pink polygons. Each of these Zones is a single tariff point. A tickets which has a Zone as its origin and/or destination gives the traveller, on the ticket's day of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until one leaves that Zone. (When purchasing a ticket, when you type in a station that is within a Zone, I think the resulting ticket automatically puts down the name of that Zone as the origin/destination.) In a Rail Pass or similar ticket, you can put down a Zone as the origin and/or destination. International rail tickets that depart from or arrives at a station within a Zone in Belgium also give the traveller free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains in that Zone until one leaves that Zone.</p>
	<p>A ticket with Mortsel, Mortsel-Liersesteenweg, Mortsel-Oude God, or Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg as its origin/destination has equal validity in the other three Mortsel stations. (However, Mortsel is not a Zone, e.g. a ticket to one of the Mortsel stations does not allow one to backtrack.)</p>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB tickets to/from Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Eijsden cost the same, and are equality valid to the other two stations. (However, Maastricht is also not a Zone.)</p>
	<p>An NMBS/SNCB return ticket from anywhere in Belgium, Roosendaal, the Maastricht stations, or Aachen Hbf to a coastal station (kuststation / gare du littoral) allows the traveller to begin the return journey from another coastal station. The coastal stations are:
Knokke, Duinbergen, Heist, Zeebrugge-Dorp, Zeebrugge-Strand, Blankenberge, Oostende, Veurne, Koksijde, and De Panne. Basically the entire coast is linked by the <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/kusttram/" target="_blank"><em>Kusttram</em> 'Coastal Tram'</a>. Ticketing of <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a>, the Flemish public transport company, applies on the Coastal Tram.</p>
	<p>Most of the points above are mentioned in the NMBS/SNCB glossary (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/A8AFD75E2FF441D9A9006F27DD659F9C.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/F9C6D129540149058BE6E25B207616D9.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>).</p>
	<p>This is the tariff tables in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>. 1 to 3 km have the same fare. For normal tickets, distances longer than 150 km are charged 150 km.</p>
	<h3 id="foreign-ticketing">Foreign ticketing</h3>	
	<p>For non-high-speed train tickets between Belgium and the Netherlands, except for between just Belgium and Roosendaal or Maastricht, which is covered by Belgian ticketing, a fixed discount is given (i.e. no need to book too early) if booked seven or more days ahead from the NMBS/SNCB or NS international websites or apps. The discount is greater for travels on non-holiday Monday to Thursday.</p>

	<p>An international tickets that has its origin or destination in a <a href="#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity', free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone. For other destinations in Belgium, an 'Any Station in Belgium' option is available for TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar.

<p>NMBS/SNCB has <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bus-tram-metro.aspx" target="_blank">various subscriptions</a> that combine travels on their trains and each of these other three other public transport operators.</p>
<p>All four Belgian public transport operators use an RFID card called <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/mobib.aspx" target="_blank">MoBIB</a>. However, currently NMBS/SNCB and De Lijn only use (personalised) MoBIB cards for subscriptions; their use for the everyday tickets has not been introduced.</p>
