<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Belgium laid the first railway in Continental Europe in 1835 (Netherlands laid its first in 1839, and Luxembourg in 1845). The three countries have well developed railway networks, connecting the vast majority of towns and cities. Within Benelux, rail is the fastest – and certainly the most convenient – way to travel between many larger cities.</p>
<p>Press the menu buttons for tips on train travel specific to each country, including videos. (Tips in this page are not necessarily repeated in those pages.) Below are the network maps that I have drawn for the regular passenger train services in Benelux in 2018; they are repeated in the country-specific pages, with further comments. Due to the complexity of the networks, especially that of Belgium, I have opted to not present everything in one map. There are differences in weekday vs. weekend operations, which is particularly noticeable in Belgium. (Click on the thumbnails to open the pdf's.)</p>
<p>General overview of the passenger train operators and their networks in Benelux:</p>

<p>The following are some notes on train travel in Benelux in general. (See also the country-specific pages!)</p> 
<h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The national railway companies are: 
	<ul>
		<li>Netherlands: NS (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Belgium: NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Luxembourg: CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	There is more than one company running trains in each country. The domestic websites/apps of the national railway companies can handle tickets for all regular domestic train journeys, even ones that are not run by them. The international websites/apps can handle single or return tickets to most destinations elsewhere in Benelux, France, Germany, and some major destinations further afield. For international journeys, the price given by different companies can be slightly different. (See the individual country pages for comments on their ticket machines.) Bordering Benelux are France and Germany; if you are going to/from/through France or Germany, you may also want to check with their national railway companies for, e.g., price, range of international tickets and destinations:
	<ul>
		<li>France: SNCF (<a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sncf.fusion" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/oui-sncf-voyages-en-train/id343889987?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Germany: DB (<a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, to buy a ticket, just input details like the 'from' and 'to' stations, the date, single/return, and class of travel (first vs second class). No need to buy separate tickets if change of trains (of the same or different companies) is involved. (Dutch Rail no longer sells domestic tickets with a 'via' option; the only case where it asks you which route to take is when there is a choice between similar routes operated by different companies. With international ticket from Dutch ticket machines, it is possible to choose which frontier to cross. In Belgium, the international website/app gives a 'via' option AND is able to issue such tickets.) The train companies also sell certain tickets that combine travel on trains and other modes of public transport, e.g. train plus bus to secondary airports. (See also the <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> and <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> pages on how their national railway companies handle passengers breaking journeys and making detours differently.)</li> 
	<li>Luxembourg has a time-based fare structure for domestic travel, with unlimited changes in all directions. There are also special return tickets to closeby international destinations. When booking online for international destinations: a) bookings across the French border are done through the <a href="https://lu.oui.sncf/fr/partenariat-cfl" target="_blank">Luxembourg site of French rail</a>, which seems to always give the same price as the France site; the France site gives a 'via' option; b) bookings across the Belgian or German border are done through a <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/voyager/reserver#TravelWish" target="_blank">Luxembourgish version of the Belgian international booking system</a>; the Luxembourgish system and the Belgian system often give different prices for the same journey. See also the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg</a> page.</li>
	<li id="dynamic-pricing">Some trains have <em>dynamic pricing</em>, especially the high-speed trains. Basically this means that the earlier you book a ticket, the better price you get. Tickets for <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv" target="_blank">TGV</a> of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (France – <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/tgv-france-brussels" target="_blank">Brussels</a>/Luxembourg), <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (England – France – Belgium, England – Belgium – Netherlands) and <a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (France – Belgium – Netherlands/Germany) have dynamic pricing (in the vast majority of cases), and seat reservation is compulsory. (Seat reservation is already included in an ordinary TGV/Eurostar/Thalys ticket; you'll have to make your own reservation if you're using a Eurail/Interrail pass, and it is pricey.) For tickets that <em>include sectors in Germany</em>, <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/trains/long-distance/ice-ice-sprinter.shtml" target="_blank">ICE</a> of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a> (Netherlands/Belgium – Germany) and InterCity (e.g. <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin" target="_blank">Amsterdam – Berlin</a>) also have dynamic pricing, but seat reservation is optional. (Cheaper tickets for ICE/InterCity/EuroCity in Germany restrict the traveller to specific trains, while full-fare tickets give flexibility.) <a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a> (Brussels – Paris) and <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">Ouigo</a> (France domestic) are lost-cost high-speed rail services; they are basically train-versions of budget airlines. (The closest Ouigo stops from Belgium and Luxembourg: <em>Tourcoing</em> near Lille (France) / Mouscron (Wallonia) / Kortrijk (Flanders); <em>Metz-Ville</em> or <em>Lorraine TGV</em> south of Luxembourg.) Seats on high-speed trains are sometimes overbooked to a small degree. However, unlike air tickets, they tell you that you're sold an overbooked ticket, and they'll get you in a train somehow.</li>
	<li>Other trains have <em>fixed pricing</em>. The number of tickets on sale is unlimited, and there is no seat reservation. In Benelux, InterCity and local trains of the same company have the same pricing structure. (This is unlike Germany and France, where Intercity/Intercités and local trains are priced differently). 
	<ul>	
		<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, you can use any train(s) (which do not require seat reservation) along the route indicated on the ticket, throughout the day, for a single/return journey. (However, there could be a surcharge; see below.) The base fare of a return ticket is just two times the price of a single ticket. In some cases there is a separate ticket-issuing cost, which means that a return ticket can be marginally cheaper than two single tickets.</li> 
		<li>In the Netherlands, there are some trajectories where more than one company runs trains; when you buy a ticket the machine/website/app will show you the price difference, and ask you to specify which company's train(s) you will catch. There is also a third option which allows you to take either option.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, there is a time-based fare structure covering nearly all modes of public transport within the country: CFL trains, foreign trains with domestic sections in Luxembourg, Luxembourgish buses, and Luxtram. The most commonly sold tickets are the 2-hour ticket, and the day ticket. For trains, there are special return tickets to some closest-by international destinations. (See also the <a href="luxembourg.html">Luxembourg page</a>.)</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li id="NLBE">For non-high-speed train travels between the Netherlands and Belgium, NS and NMBS/SNCB offer a fixed-rate discount for tickets bought seven or more days in advance from their international websites (<a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a>) or apps. The discount is on average 40&#37; for journeys on Monday to Thursday, and 20&#37; for journeys on Friday to Sunday. There is no seat reservation, and you can use any train during the day along the designated route, crossing a specific frontier point. The number of tickets is limitless; the discounted price remain the same seven or more days in advance (i.e. there is no need to book a lot earlier than seven days ahead), while the normal full-flex price remain the same throughout. These discounted tickets are mid-flex, with s. <em>The ticket machines and ticket counters do not give this discount!</em> (However, NMBS/SNCB gives a better fixed rate price for journeys between just Roosendaal and Belgium, or between just Maastricht and Belgium, as these are operated solely by NMBS/SNCB, and Belgian ticketing applies. The old day-return and weekend-return tickets between the Netherlands and Belgium were scrapped on 9th April 2018.)</li>
	<li id="BELU">For travels between Belgium and Luxembourg, there are the mid-flex tickets of weekend return (depart on Friday–Sunday, return on Saturday–Sunday), and youth (25 years or younger, single or return), both giving 30% off full-flex. There are also the no-flex return tickets called Escapade 1/2/3: €54/76/98 in second class, €88/137/182 in first class, 1/2/3 people can make a return journey betwen any Belgian station and any Luxembourgish station within 30 days (non-exchangeable and non-refundable). (See also the special short-distance return tickets between Belgium and Luxembourg in the <a href="belgium.html#luxembourg">Belgium</a> or <a href="luxembourg.html#belgium">Luxembourg</a> page.)</li>
	<li>Between the Netherlands and Luxembourg: if going through Belgium, then the aforementioned Belgian-Dutch rules apply; if going through Germany, you'll likely go on ICE/IC, and German dynamic pricing applies. Going through Belgium is probaly faster and cheaper. But if you have to book tickets within six days, or you cannot get an e-ticket for any reason, it is also worth looking into going through Germany instead of Belgium. This is especially the case for Dutch cities like Arnhem and Venlo close to the German border. Even to/from Amsterdam, the low-flex tickets through Germany could be cheaper than the normal tickets through Belgium that you book within six days of departure.</li>
	<li>Surcharges (no seat reservation is possible for these):
	<ul>
		<li>For the Amsterdam–Berlin InterCity service, domestic travel within the Netherlands on this service is just like any other domestic InterCity services, and there is no surcharge.</li>
		<li>For ICE, domestic travel within the Netherlands requires normal domestic ticketing plus an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases waived). For domestic travel on the ICE within Belgium, the surcharge is €8 for second class, and €12 for first class (tickets sold at international ticket counters).
		<li>For Intercity direct, there is an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases discounted) for the high-speed rail line between Schiphol and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This surcharge is not applicable to tickets to/from/through Belgium and through Schiphol – Rotterdam.</li>
		<li>The station of Brussels Airport-Zaventem has a station access fee of €5.30 (the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">Diabolo fee</a>), for each passenger passing through the ticket gates each time. (See <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/tickets/diabolo-fee-to-airport/no-diabolo.aspx" target="_blank">who</a> is exempt this fee.)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There are the <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en" target="_blank">Interrail</a> and <a href="https://www.eurail.com/en" target="_blank">Eurail</a> rail passes. (Interrail is the cheaper option available to European citizens and residents; see <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en/help/ordering-pass/do-i-need-interrail-or-eurail-pass" target="_blank">here</a> for eligibility for Interrail vs. Eurail.) These rail passes are not the best value (for people with simple itineraries at least), but give huge flexibility. Interrail/Eurail treats Benelux as one country for their rail passes. A one-country Benelux pass can be used by residents outside Benelux. Just for comparison, with a sample intinerary of Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam on three separate days, catching only Intercity direct and InterCity (i.e. no seat reservations):
	<ul>
		<li>Interrail adult second class Benelux one-country pass, three days in a month: €121 (or €40.33 per day).</li> 
		<li>Buying individual tickets online, for travelling within the next few days, second class full fare: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €46.8, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €70. Total = €160.4.</li>
		<li>Amsterdam – Brussels return €93.6, Brussels – Luxembourg return €54. Total = 147.6</li>	
		<li>For travelling a week later, e-tickets: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €25/€33, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €38/€48. Total = €106.6 (all journeys on Mon-Thurs)/ €124.6 (all journeys on Fri-Sun).
		<li>Amsterdam – Brussels return €50/€66, Brussels – Luxembourg return €54. Total = €104 (all journeys on Mon-Thurs)/€120 (all journeys on Fri-Sun)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>A RailPlus card gives 15 percent off <em>full-fare tickets</em> for international train travel between many European countries, <em>on trains without compulsory reservation</em>. Given that this is a discount off full-fare tickets, and the discount is now only 15% (it used to be 25% before 2018), in a lot of cases it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. Using the same Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam trip as an example, for a traveller with a Dutch <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/dal-voordeel.html" target="_blank"><em>Dal Voordeel</em></a> subscription (40%-off off-peak within the Netherlands) plus RailPlus (15% off in Belgium and Luxembourg when crossing borders), travelling off-peak second class: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €33.2, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €37.2, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €52.9. Total = €123.3.
	<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, a <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/train-fares-and-discounts/other-discounts#tab__railplus" target="_blank">RailPlus</a> card costs €15, but it requires you to have an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets" target="_blank">anuual subscription</a> with NS first.</li>
		<li>In <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Railplus" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/railplus/railplus" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>, a RailPlus card costs €50, or €25 for 0-25/60+ year-olds.</li>
		<li>In Germany, RailPlus is included in a DB <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/vorteile/railplus.shtml" target="_blank">BahnCard</a> subscription.</li>
		<li>In France, SNCF gives 25% discount for travels to Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg (and also Spain for youths) with their <a href="https://www.oui.sncf/promotion-train/multi/europe/carte-abonnement" target="_blank"><em>cartes de réduction</em></a>. It says <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/RailPlus" target="_blank">here</a> (information is not necessarily up to date) that RailPlus is not valid in France for 26-59 year-olds.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>For people making multiple long-ish trips in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB has a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/now-and-then/rail-pass.aspx" target="_blank">Rail Pass</a> for 10 trips in a year between any stations in Belgium for €77 (second class) (see also the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page). This NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass can be purchased by anyone, and it can be used by multiple people travelling together. (People younger than 26 years old get even better deals from NMBS/SNCB.) Using the same Brussels &#62; Luxembourg trip as an example, for people with a lot of time to spare, on non-holiday weekdays, instead of catching an InterCity straight from Brussels to Luxembourg with one ticket (normal price €43.6, second class one way), you can catch an IC from Brussels to Arlon near the border, and then an L train south to Athus (normal price second class €22.2, or €7.7 with an NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass). Luxembourg extends domestic pricing to Athus on their trains/buses, so you can get a 2-hour Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app/train conductor for €2/€3 to get from Athus to anywhere in Luxembourg within two hours. (Or a day ticket for €4/€5.) (See also the special short-distance return tickets between Belgium and Luxembourg in the <a href="belgium.html#luxembourg">Belgium</a> or <a href="luxembourg.html#belgium">Luxembourg</a> page.)</li>
	<li>People residing outside Europe (including Turkey and Russia) can purchase a <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/passes/german-rail-pass.shtml" target="_blank">German Rail Pass</a>. In Benelux, it covers the Brussels – Liège – Aachen – Cologne <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE" target="_blank">ICE</a> line, and the <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/bus/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB IC Bus</a> lines to Belgium and the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>If you do not have a valid ticket before you board a non-high-speed train (there are no ticket machines inside Dutch/Belgian/Luxembourgish trains):
		<ul>
		<li>In the Netherlands, you have to buy a ticket from them, plus a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/payment/deferred-payments.html" target="_blank">fine of €50</a>, which is the same for all Dutch railway companies.</li>
		<li>In Belgium, you can go to the train conductor (attendent) and buy a ticket. (DO NOT wait till the train conductor comes to you.) However, there is a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">surcharge of €7</a> for all journeys that begin in Belgium (i.e. the surcharge is not applicable if you join a Belgian local/IC train in a neighbouring country). See also their <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/boordtarief.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. If you fail to buy a ticket, the fine is €75.</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">tickets</a> can be bought from a train conductor with a €1 surcharge per ticket. You can buy a 2-hour-ticket or 1-day-ticket from the conductor. If you are caught without a valid ticket in a train/bus/tram in Luxembourg, the fine is €150.</li></ul>
Pretending to be a 'dumb tourist' basically never works. Train conductors are authorised to check your ID and issue you a fine. If none of the ticket machines work and there is no other way of purchasing a ticket at the station, theoratically this information will show up in the train conductors' hand-held devices, and you'll avoid a surcharge/fine in Belgium and the Netherlands (try to convey this information to the train conductor before boarding the train). It is also not difficult to purchase a ticket via the apps of the railway companies (familiarise yourself with these apps before getting to a station). If you lose your ticket (e.g. if your belongings are stolen), go and seek help from a train conductor, and you will not be fined if they are satisfied that your case is genuine.</li>
	<li>See the <a href="netherlands.html#germany">Germany section</a> in the Netherlands page for comments on German non-high-speed trains.</li>
	<li>All(?) railway companies give compensation over majorily delayed journeys. Please read up on their rules over delay compensation online. Best if you make a video as your delayed train arrives at the destination, clearly showing the train, clocks at the railway station, plus some other way of showing dates (e.g. a newspaper, asking the train conductor to tell the time and date). Railway companies might lie about how delayed their trains are when you seek compensation. (I've been lied to many times by a high-speed rail company.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other matters concerning travelling on regular trains</h3>
<ul>	      
	<li>Like other European countries, trains that do not have compulsory seat reservation have two classes of travel: first class and second class. You can tell which carriages/ which section of a carriage is first or second class by a big number 1 or 2 next to the doors, and the difference in the colour of the seats. Long distance train carriages have two sets of exterior doors, one near each end of the carriage. In the Netherlands, a first class section is usually just between the front and back doors, or sometimes half the length of that, with the first class section separated from the rest of the carriage by glass doors. In Belgium, however, the first class section can be the entire carriage, including the seats that are further forward than the front doors/ further backward than the back doors. Check the colour of the seats carefully.
	<li>In some smaller trains, the first class seats are just a few seats at the very front or very back of the train, with or without a glass door separating those from the rest of the carriage. Some smaller trains have no first class seats.</li> 
	<figure><a href="images/P_20180527_093451.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="images/P_20180527_093451.jpg" alt="Zutphen big 2 P_20180527_093451.jpg" style="height:200px;border:0px"></a>
	<figcaption>The big 2 on Blauwnet trains in the Netherlands; this Zuthphen – Oldenzaal Keolis train has no first class seats</figcaption></figure></li> 
	<li>Having a ticket, either first class or second class, does not guarentee a seat. With a second class ticket, you can walk through a first class section to get to another second class section, but you are theortically not allowed to travel while standing in a first class section, not even when the second class sections are packed full of standing passengers. (This is the case with the Netherlands; I assume this is also the case with Belgium and Luxembourg. If in doubt, ask.)</li>
	<li>If you have a high-speed rail ticket, do not assume that you can automatically catch a slower train over the same trajectory if, e.g., you miss your designated high-speed train. For instance, if you have a Thalys or Eurostar ticket from Amsterdam to Brussels or further, DO NOT assume that you can therefore catch the slower Intercity direct to get to Brussels. After all, 1) a cheap Thalys/Eurostar ticket for Amsterdam–Brussels is cheaper than a full-fare Intercity direct ticket that you have to buy on the spot; and 2) NS (Dutch Rail) does not have shares in Thalys or Eurostar. Similarly, ICE in Belgium is run by NS (Dutch Rail) and DB (German Rail); if you have an ICE ticket from Brussels to Germany, DO NOT assume that you can use that ticket to catch a Belgian train, or a Thalys train, to Liège and spend some time there before heading to Germany. If you miss your high-speed train, ask railway staff, they might be able to help you (e.g. your ticket might actually be flexible enough to allow changes even after the departure time). If it is the railway company's fault that you miss your train connection, they should be able to help you. (But don't count on them helping you if you miss your last possible connection. Accidents can happen; it is best to avoid having to rely on the last possible connection, or even the last few possible connections.)</li>
	<li>At major train stations there can be security checks before one boards a train, especially with high-speed trains in <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Journey#SecurityChecks" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and France. Check the websites of the high-speed rail companies for security check arrangements. Arrive at the station/platform with ample time to spare.</li>
	<li>For Eurostar passengers going from Brussels to England, there is a <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/be-en/travel-info/your-trip/check-in" target="_blank">check-in procedure</a>, full-scale security check, Schengen immigration check, and UK immigration check at Brussels-Midi/Zuid ("Brussels-South"). (Customs check is conducted at arrival in UK. For Eurostar passengers going to just France, there is a separate check-in terminal at Brussels-South.) The Dutch and British governments have not yet come to agreement on British immigration and security arrangements at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal, so for journeys from the Netherlands to London, Eurostar put customers on Thalys/Eurostar trains to get to Brussels-South first, where passengers go through immigration and security checks. Or you might choose to make your own way to Brussels-South. In any case, get to Brussels-South with plenty of spare time if you catch Eurostar. This is what Eurostar says about <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/be-en/travel-info/your-trip/check-in" target="_blank">check-in times</a></li>
	<li>Systematic checks have been abolished at the international borders within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a> (Benelux, France, and West Germany were the original signatories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" target="_blank">Schengen Agreement</a> in 1985). Trains most usually run straight through the land borders between Benelux, France, and Germany. However, you could still have your ID and belongings checked by police or customs officers anywhere, including railway stations, or even inside moving trains. In special circumstances, systematic checks at the borders can be reinstated. Remember to have your passport or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area" target="_blank">EEA</a>/Swiss-issued ID card with you, and try avoiding tight connections in general.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special trains</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are no longer regular long-distance night trains or autotrains in Benelux. The closest access points for these are:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">ÖBB</a> (Austrian Rail)'s <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a> from Germany (Hamburg, Hannover, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich). Some ÖBB Nightjet trains can take <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/ausstattung/automotorrad.html" target="_blank">cars and motorcycles</a>. ÖBB is interested in running night trains to the Netherlands, and this service might start in 2020;</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail)'s <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/intercites" target="_blank">Intercités de Nuit</a> from Paris-Austerlitz. SNCF has a separate <a href="https://www.sncf.com/sncv1/en/services/cars-motorcycles-bicycles" target="_blank">autotrain</a> service from Paris-Bercy (no passengers).</li></ul></li>
	<li>Not included in the maps are charter trains to, e.g., ski destinations in winter, music festivals in summer. (I know of <a href="https://www.treinreiswinkel.nl/reizen/wintersport-vakanties" target="_blank">Treinreiswinkel</a>, and <a href="https://festival.travel/travel/festivaltreinen/" target="_blank">Festival.Travel</a>.) All (?) of these charter trains are night trains.</li>

<h3>Developments on train travels in Benelux since 10-12-2017:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>01-01-2018: NRW-Tarif is now valid on RE 18 Heerlen – Herzogenrath.</li>
	<li>14-01-2018: RB 61 starts operating between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim. (In reality, replacement buses run till Sunday 25-02-2018.)</li>
	<li>12-02-2018: The station of Waddinxveen Triangel opens, on the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line.</li>
	<li>20-02-2018: Eurostar announces its London–Amsterdam schedule from 04-04-2018.</li>
	<li>23-02-2018: NS announces that the non-peak surcharge-free period for Intercity direct is extended till 08-04-2018. (During this period, there is a surcharge for Intercity direct between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal only between 06:30–09:30 and 16:00–19:00 on weekdays.)</li>
	<li>28-03-2018: The station of Eemshaven opens; Eemshaven is now the northern-most train station in the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>04-04-2018: Eurostar begins its operation in the Netherlands. However, border control in the Netherlands cannot start until at least the end of 2019; when passengers travel towards London, passengers have to disembark and go through Schengen and UK border controls in Brussels. The train towards London stops at Brussels for 1 hour 18 minutes; Eurostar usually put passengers on Thalys trains to get to Brussels.
	<li>09-04-2018: IC Amsterdam – Brussels rerouted to high-speed rail lines. (In the few months before this, nearly all trains terminated at Den Haag Hollands Spoor instead, running only on non-high-speed rail lines.) 12 trains per day run through the Schiphol–Rotterdam high-speed line to/from Amsterdam (these are now classed as Intercity direct in the Netherlands), while 4 trains per day goes to/from Den Haag HS (these remain InterCity). Dordrecht and Roosendaal are now skipped by the IC, while Breda and Noorderkempen are added.</li>
	<li>09-04-2018: Replacement buses for P/RE trains no longer run between Gouvy and Troisvierges.</li>
	<li>26-05-2018: L train service between Roosendaal and Puurs disconnected at Essen. This lasts till late August(?).</li>
</ul>
