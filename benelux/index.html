<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Belgium laid the first railway in Continental Europe in 1835 (Netherlands laid its first in 1839, and Luxembourg in 1845). The three countries have well developed railway networks, connecting the vast majority of towns and cities. Within Benelux, rail is the fastest – and certainly the most convenient – way to travel between many larger city centres. High-speed and InterCity trains often run faster than cars on motorways.</p>
<p>Press the menu buttons for tips on train travel specific to each country, including videos. Below are all the network maps that I have drawn for the regular passenger train services in Benelux in 2018. (They are repeated in the country-specific pages, with further comments.) Due to the complexity of the networks, especially that of Belgium, I have opted to not present everything in one map.</p>	
<p>General overview of the passenger train operators and their networks in Benelux:</p>

<p>The following are some notes on train travel in Benelux in general (see also the country-specific pages!): <br/>Ticketing matters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The national railway companies: 
	<ul>
		<li>Netherlands: NS (<a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-reisplanner-xtra/id370362301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nshispeed" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ns-international/id886645737?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Belgium: NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Luxembourg: CFL (<a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	There is more than one company running trains in each country. The domestic websites/apps of the national railway companies can handle tickets for all (regular) domestic train journeys, even ones that are not run by them. The international websites/apps can handle tickets to basically all destinations elsewhere in Benelux, many destinations in France and Germany, and some major destinations further afield. For international journeys, the price given by different companies can be slightly different. If you are going to/from/through France or Germany, also check with their national railway companies:
	<ul>
		<li>France: SNCF (<a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sncf.fusion" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/oui-sncf-voyages-en-train/id343889987?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
		<li>Germany: DB (<a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, to buy a ticket for a domestic journey, or an international journey that the website/app can handle, just input details like the 'from' and 'to' stations, the date, single/return, and class of travel (first vs second). No need to buy separate tickets if change of train/company is involved. If you want to make a detour between your 'from' and 'to' locations, there is also a 'via' option, where you can input an in-between destination. The exception to this is the domestic website for Belgium, where you have to buy two separate tickets if the in-between destination involves a detour. (See also the Netherlands and Belgian pages on how their national railway companies handle passengers breaking journeys and making detours differently.) Luxembourg has a time-based fare structure for the entire country; see below.</li>
	<li>Some trains have <em>dynamic pricing</em>, especially the high-speed trains. Basically this means that the earlier you book a ticket, the better price you will get. Tickets for TGV of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (France – Brussels/Luxembourg), <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/trains" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> (England – France – Belgium – Netherlands) and <a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/" target="_blank">Thalys</a> (France – Belgium – Netherlands/Germany) have dynamic pricing, and seat reservation is compulsory. (Seat reservation is already included in an ordinary TGV/Eurostar/Thalys ticket, but you'll have to make your own reservation if you're using a Eurail/Interrail pass.) {ICE of <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB International</a> (Netherlands/Belgium – Germany) and InterCity (Amsterdam – Berlin)} tickets that include sectors in Germany also have dynamic pricing, but seat reservation is optional. (Cheaper tickets for ICE/InterCity/EuroCity in Germany restrict the traveller to specific trains, while full-fare tickets give flexibility.) <a href="https://www.izy.com/en" target="_blank">IZY</a> (Brussels – Paris) and <a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">Ouigo</a> (France domestic) are lost-cost high-speed rail services; they are basically train-versions of budget airlines. (The closest Ouigo access points from Benelux: Tourcoing near Lille/the western end of the Flanders–Wallonia border; Metz-Ville or Lorraine TGV south of Luxembourg.)</li>
	<li>Other trains have <em>fixed pricing</em>. The number of tickets on sale is unlimited, and there is no seat reservation. In Benelux, InterCity and local trains of the same company have the same pricing structure (unlike Germany and France where InterCity and local trains are priced differently). 
	<ul>	
		<li>In the Netherlands and Belgium, you can use any train(s) (which do not require seat reservation) along the route indicated on the ticket, for a single journey or a return journey, throughout the day. The base fare of a return ticket is just two times the price of a single ticket. (There could be a separate ticket-issuing cost, which means that a return ticket can be marginally cheaper than two single tickets.)</li> 
		<li>In the Netherlands, there are some trajectories where more than one company runs trains; if there is a price difference, which there usually is, when you buy a ticket the machine/website/app will show you the price difference, and ask you to specify which company's train(s) you will catch (there is also a third option which allows you to take either option).</li>
		<li>In Luxembourg, there is a time-based fare structure covering all modes of public transport (train, bus, tram; including foreign trains) within the country. There is a 2-hour ticket, and a day ticket, which is valid until 04:00 the following day.</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li>For train travels between the Netherlands and Belgium, NS and NMBS/SNCB offer a fixed-rate discount for tickets bought seven or more days in advance from their international website (<a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a>) or app (see above). The discount is larger for journeys on Monday to Thursday. There is no seat reservation, and you can use any train during the day along the designated route (crossing a specific border point). The number of tickets is limitless; the discounted price remain the same seven or more days in advance (i.e. there is no need to book super early), and the normal full-flex price remain the same throughout. The discounted tickets are less-flexible than the normal full-flex tickets, in terms of changes and cancellations. <em>No discount is given by the ticket machines!</em> (This type of cross-border discount is not applicable to journeys between just Roosendaal and Belgium, or between just Maastricht and Belgium, as these are operated solely by NMBS/SNCB. The old day-return and weekend-return tickets between the Netherlands and Belgium were scrapped on 9th April 2018.)</li>
	<li>Surcharges (no seat reservation is possible/needed for these):
	<ul>
		<li>For the Amsterdam–Berlin InterCity service, domestic travel within the Netherlands on this service is just like any other domestic InterCity services, and there is no surcharge.</li>
		<li>For ICE, domestic travel within the Netherlands requires normal domestic ticketing plus an <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/toeslagen/p/toeslag-ice" target="_blank">ICE supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases this surcharge is waived). For domestic travel on the ICE within Belgium, the surcharge is €8 for second class, and €12 for first class (tickets sold at international ticket counters).
		<li>For Intercity direct, there is a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets/other/intercity-direct-supplement.html" target="_blank">Intercity direct supplement</a> of €2.40 (pre-purchased; in some cases discounted) for the section between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal in the Netherlands. This surcharge is not applicable to tickets through Schiphol Airport–Rotterdam Centraal to/from/through Belgium.</li>
		<li>The station of Brussels Airport-Zaventem has a station access fee (the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">Diabolo fee</a>) of €5.30, for going through the ticket gates each time.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There are the <a href="https://www.eurail.com/en" target="_blank">Eurail</a> and <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en" target="_blank">Interrail</a> rail passes. (Interrail is the cheaper option available to European citizens and residents; 'Europe' is Russia, Turkey, Republic of Cypurs, and all countries and territories in Europe to the west. Eurail is for non-European citizens residing outside Europe. For people of mixed European and non-European citizenship and residency statuses, both are available. There are some differences in their rules. Eurail has more types of passes than Interrail.) These rail passes are often not the best value (for people with simple itineraries), but give huge flexibility. Eurail/Interrail treats Benelux as one country for their rail passes. A one-country Benelux pass can be used by residents outside Benelux. Just for comparison, with a sample intinerary of Amsterdam &#62; Brussels &#62; Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam on three separate days, catching only trains that do not have seat reservations (Intercity direct/ InterCity):
	<ul>
		<li>Interrail adult second class Benelux one-country pass, three days in a month: €121 (or €40.33 per day).</li> 
		<li>Buying individual tickets, for travelling within the next few days, second class full fare: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €46.8, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €70. Total = €160.4.</li>
		<li>For travelling a week later, purchased online: Amsterdam &#62; Brussels €25/33, Brussels &#62; Luxembourg €43.6, Luxembourg &#62; Amsterdam €38/48. Total = €106.6 (all journeys on Mon-Thurs)/ €124.6 (all journeys on Fri-Sun).
		</ul></li>
	<li>For people making multiple long-ish trips in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB has a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/age/adults-seniors/now-and-then/rail-pass.aspx" target="_blank">Rail Pass</a> for 10 trips between any stations in Belgium in a year for €77 (€7.7 per trip). The pass can be used by multiple people at the same time. For the same Brussels &#62; Luxembourg one way journey, the Brussels &#62; Arlon domestic leg cost €7.7 with this NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, and the Arlon &#62; Luxembourg international leg costs €10.5. You can remain on the train throughout, if you have filled in the rail pass and pre-purchased the international ticket. (On non-holiday weekdays that the Arlon–Athus trains run, it is even cheaper if you make a detour to Athus; for railway travel, Athus is the only station in Belgium that Luxembourg extends domestic pricing to.) People younger than 26 years old get even better deals from NMBS/SNCB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other matters:</p>
<ul>	      
	<li>There are no longer regular long-distance night trains or autotrains in Benelux. The closest access points for international night trains are <a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target="_blank">ÖBB</a> (Austrian Rail)'s <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a> from Germany (Hamburg, Hannover, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Berlin, Münich), and <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail)'s <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/intercites" target="_blank">Intercités de Nuit</a> from Paris-Austerlitz. Some ÖBB Nightjet trains can take <a href="http://www.nightjet.com/en/ausstattung/automotorrad.html" target="_blank">cars/motorcycles</a>. SNCF has a separate <a href="https://www.sncf.com/sncv1/en/services/cars-motorcycles-bicycles" target="_blank">autotrain</a> service from Paris-Bercy (no passengers). (ÖBB is interested in running night trains to the Netherlands, and this service might start in 2020.)</li>
	<li>Not included in the maps are charter trains to, e.g., ski destinations in winter, festivals in summer. (From the Netherlands, I know of <a href="https://www.treinreiswinkel.nl/reizen/wintersport-vakanties" target="_blank">Treinreiswinkel</a>, and <a href="https://festival.travel/travel/festivaltreinen/" target="_blank">Festival.Travel</a>.) Many of these charter trains are night trains.</li>
	<li>Like other European countries, trains that do not have compulsory seat reservation have two classes of seats: first class and second class. You can tell which carriages/ which section of a carriage is first or second class by a big number 1 or 2 next to doors, and the difference in the colour of the seats. Long distance train carriages have two sets of exterior doors, one near each end of the carriage. In the Netherlands, a first class section is usually just between the front and back doors, or sometimes half the length of that, with the first class section separated from the rest by glass doors. In Belgium, however, the first class section can be the entire carriage, including the seats that are not between the front and back exterior doors. Check the colour of the seats carefully.</li> 
	<li>In some smaller trains, the first class seats are just a few seats at the very front, or the verb back of the train, with or without a glass door separating those from the rest of the carriage. Some smaller trains have no first class seats.</li> 
	<li>Having a ticket, either first class or second class, does not guarentee a seat. With a second class ticket, you can walk through a first class section to get to another second class section, but you are theortically not allow to stand still in a first class section, not even when the second class sections are packed with standing passengers. (This is the case with the Netherlands; I assume this is also the case with Belgium and Luxembourg. If in doubt, ask.)</li>
	<li>If you have a high-speed rail ticket, do not assume that you can automatically catch a slower train over the same trajectory, if, e.g., you missed your designated high-speed train. For instance, if you have a Thalys or Eurostar ticket from Amsterdam to Brussels or further, DO NOT assume that you can therefore catch the slower Intercity direct to get to Brussels; afterall, Dutch rail does not have shares in Thalys nor Eurostar. If you miss your train, ask railway staff, and they might be able to help you. If it is the railway company's fault that you miss your train connection, they should be able to help you. (But don't count on them helping you if you miss your last possible connection.)</li>
	<li>Unless it is the railway company's fault, basically no one will pity you if you miss your train. At major train stations there could be security checks before one boards a train, especially with high-speed trains in Belgium and France. Check the websites of the high-speed rail companies for security check arrangements. Arrive at the station/platform with ample time to spare.</li>
	<li>For Eurostar passengers going from Brussels to England, there are full-scale security checks, Schengen immigration check, and UK immigration check at Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi ("Brussels-South"). (Customs check is conducted at arrival in UK. For Eurostar passengers going to just France, there is a separate check-in terminal at Brussels-South.) The Dutch and British governments have not yet  come to agreement about British immigration and security requirements at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal, so for journeys towards UK, Eurostar put passengers on Thalys train, or their own trains, to get to Brussels first to go through immigration and security checks there. Or you might choose to make your own way to Brussels first. In any case, get to Brussels-South with plenty of spare time!</li>
	<li>Systematic checks have been abolished at the international borders within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a> (Benelux, France, and West Germany were the original signatories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" target="_blank">Schengen Agreement</a> in 1985). However, you could still have your ID and belongings checked by police or customs officers anywhere, including railway stations, or even inside moving trains. In special circumstances, systematic checks can be reinstated. Remember to have your passport or EU-issued ID with you, and try to not have tight connections in general.</li>

<p>Developments on train travels in Benelux since 10-12-2017:</p>
<ul>
	<li>01-01-2018: NRW-Tarif is now valid on RE 18 Heerlen – Herzogenrath.</li>
	<li>14-01-2018: RB 61 starts operating between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim. (In reality, replacement buses run till Sunday 25-02-2018.)</li>
	<li>12-02-2018: The station of Waddinxveen Triangel opens, on the Gouda – Alphen aan den Rijn line.</li>
	<li>20-02-2018: Eurostar announces its London–Amsterdam schedule from 04-04-2018.</li>
	<li>23-02-2018: NS announces that the non-peak surcharge-free period for Intercity direct is extended till 08-04-2018. (During this period, there is a surcharge for Intercity direct between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal only between 06:30–09:30 and 16:00–19:00 on weekdays.)</li>
	<li>28-03-2018: The station of Eemshaven opens; Eemshaven is now the northern-most train station in the Netherlands.</li>
	<li>04-04-2018: Eurostar begins its operation in the Netherlands. However, border control in the Netherlands cannot start until at least the end of 2019; when passengers travel towards London, passengers have to disembark and go through Schengen and UK border controls in Brussels. The train towards London stops at Brussels for 1 hour 18 minutes; Eurostar usually put passengers on Thalys trains to get to Brussels.
	<li>09-04-2018: IC Amsterdam – Brussels rerouted to high-speed lines. 12 trains per day run through the Schiphol–Rotterdam high-speed line to/from Amsterdam (these are now classed as Intercity direct in the Netherlands), while 4 trains per day goes to/from Den Haag HS (these remain InterCity). Dordrecht and Roosendaal are now skipped by the IC, while Breda and Noorderkempen are added.</li>
	<li>09-04-2018: Replacement buses for P/RE trains no longer run between Gouvy and Troisvierges.</li>
