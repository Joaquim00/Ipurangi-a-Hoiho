<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Luxembourg (Luxembourgish <em>Lëtzebuerg</em>, French <em>Luxembourg</em>, German/Dutch <em>Luxemburg</em>). See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about Luxembourg in that page are repeated here.</p>  
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Luxembourg. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Luxembourg (plus the Netherlands and Belgium).</p>

<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CFL (<em>Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois</em> 'National Company of the Luxembourgish Railways'; <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>. <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">International booking website for France</a>; <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">International booking website for other countries</a>): the Luxembourgish national railway company. Its network extends a little bit into Belgium and France, and a long way into Germany.</a>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Also runs coach services to <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Hbf</a> in Germany and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Lorraine TGV</a> in France.</li>
	      </ul></li>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Belgian national railway company; runs all the way into Luxembourg City from the west and north:
	<ul>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs the InterCity services west to Namur/Brussels.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs some of the local services on the same line to Kleinbettingen/Arlon.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB and CFL jointly run the InterCity services north to Liège/Liers.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</em>: the regional branch of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail) in the Grand Est region of France; runs a TER (regional) service between Luxembourg and Merz or Nancy to the south.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail) (Luxembourg to Paris Est about 6 times per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Montpellier once per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Marseille once per day). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Two OUIGO stations easily accessible from Luxembourg are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV to the south.</p>
	      <h3 id="types-of-train-services">Types of train services</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patters, there are various types of train services in Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish nomenclature for types of non-high-speed services is basically the same as German nomenclature (but in Luxembourgish).</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>RegionalBunn</em> (RB): all-stops service.</li>
	<li><em>Regional-Express</em> (RE): skips some stops.</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): usually only stops at larger stations.</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The InterCity to the west of Luxembourg City (Namur/Brussels) is run by NMBS/SNCB trains. On the same line, the RE/RB between Luxembourg and Kleinbettingen/Arlon is run by CFL trains or NMBS/SNCB trains. The InterCity to the north of Luxembourg City (Liège/Liers) is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB (often CFL locomotive with NMBS/SNCB carriages.) To the east of Luxembourg City, CFL runs an RE per hour to Trier Hbf and Koblenz Hbf. In Germany this service is called the RE 11. Once per day, the CFL RE 11 continues further from Koblenz Hbf, and becomes an IC to Bonn Hbf, Köln Hbf (i.e. Cologne), and Düsseldorf Hbf. (CFL's RE 11 train is often coupled with DB Regio Südwest's RE 1 train between Koblenz Hbf and Trier Hbf: after arriving at Trier Hbf from Koblenz Hbf, they are decoupled; RE 11 continues to Luxembourg, while RE 1 continues to Saarbrücken Hbf and Mannheim Hbf.)</p>
	  <p>For French trains in Luxembourg, French nomenclature is also used:</p>
	  <li><em>Transport express régional</em> (TER): SNCF's brand of regional trains. They can be all-stops, or more like an RE. Some can travel very far. They make more stops than <em>Intercités</em>.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a>: SNCF's high-speed rail service.</li>
<p>The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Luxembourg and Belgium.</p>

	  <p>'P train' is a Belgian nomenclature for supplementary services (primarily added services during peak-hours). These services in Luxembourg are classified as RB, RE, or IC, based primarily on their stopping pattern in Luxembourg. (But they do have the same train number in both countries.)</p>

	      <p>You may be interested in the CFL printed timetables for <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/horaires/horaires-imprim%C3%A9s/horaires-nationaux-en-pdf" target="_blank">domestic/cross-border destinations</a>, and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/horaires/horaires-imprim%C3%A9s/horaires-internationaux-en-pdf" target="_blank">international destinations</a>. Printed versions of these are also given out for free at certain train stations. CFL also has this <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/fr/Documents/0General/Docs-Caches/RET2018.pdf" target="_blank">timetable netgraph</a>(!!!) for domestic and and some cross-border services. (The information is not necessarily up to date; always check with CFL for the latest information.)</p>
	  <h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	  <h4>Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h4>
	  <h5 id="validity-area">Validity area of Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h5>
	  <p>For domestic and some cross-border traffic, Luxembourg has a unified time-based ticketing system for basically all forms of public transport. Other than domestic train travel in Luxembourg, the tickets also cover the buses and trams of Luxembourgish bus/tram companies: <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/" target="_blank">AVL</a> (Luxembourg City bus), a href="http://www.tice.lu/en" target="_blank">TICE</a> (Southwest/Esch-sur-Alzette area bus), RGTR (countrywide bus), <a href="http://www.luxtram.lu/" target="_blank">Luxtram</a>. (The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/gares-et-services/nos-gares/pfaffenthal-kirchberg" target="_blank">CFL funicular</a> linking Pfaffenthal-Kircheberg station and the Luxtram line is <em>free of charge</em>!) For cross-border public transport, the Luxembourgish tickets cover / not cover:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For trains:
		<ul>
			<li>Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France are disconnected from the French passenger rail network; these two stations are listed like other domestic stations in CFL's <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/gares-et-services/nos-gares" target="_blank">list of stations</a>, and they have Luxembourgish ticket machines. I suppose Luxembourgish domestic tickets apply at these two stations, but you should ask.</li>
			<li>Athus in Belgium is considered the same tariff point as Rodange in Luxembourg. In other words, Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus. However, there are no CFL ticket machines at Athus. (I asked CFL.) At Athus, you can either purchase Luxembourgish tickets in the CFL app or mTicket app, or from a CFL train conductor, with a surcharge of €1.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>For buses:
		<ul>
			<li>Luxembourgish tickets are not valid on <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonian) buses. However, <a href="https://www.infotec.be/fr-be/acheteruntitre/titresettarifs/abonnements.aspx" target="_blank">TEC subscriptions</a> from TEC Namur-Luxembourg <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers" target="_blank">are valid</a> on AVL and RGTR buses. There seems to be no French or German local buses operating in Luxembourg.</li>
			<li>Domestic Luxembourgish tickets are valid on Luxembourgish bus destinations to some closest-by international localities. For further localities, there is a <em>RégioZone 1</em> and <em>RégioZone 2</em> tariff levels. See <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers/regiozone" target="_blank">this page</a>, and the attachements (a list and a map) towards the bottom of that page for localities in Belgium, France, and Germany where each of the three levels of tariff applies.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5>Types of tickets</h5>
<p>The most common tickets sold by <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">CFL</a>are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Short time ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Kuerzzäitbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet courte durée</em>), €2 second class, €3 first class: two hours validity from validation.</li>
	<li>Day ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Dagesbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet longue durée 1 jour</em>, €4 second calss, €6 first class: valid from validation till 04:00 the following day.</li>
	<li>1 day group ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Gruppenbilljee 1 Dag</em>, French <em>Billet de groupe longue durée 1 jour</em>, €12 second class: ticket for 5 people, valid from validation till 04:00 the following day.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also 2 and 3 day versions of these tickets; their costs are just multiples of the 1 day tickets.</p>
<p>These Luxembourgish tickets give unlimited transfers amongst the modes of public transport where these tickets are valid (see <a href="#validity-area">above</a>). Passengers have to leave the train/bus/tram before the ticket expires, based on the timetable schedule of that train/bus/tram service. (Fine for not having a valid public transport ticket in Luxembourg is €150.)</p>
<p>Other than these 2-hour and day tickets, there are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-mensuels" target="_blank">monthly</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels" target="_blank">annual</a> subscriptions. With the monthly and annual subscriptions, there is an 'entire network' option, and a 'short distance' option. In the clauses of the 'short distance' subscriptions is a hexagon map; short distance is six hexagons away from a centre point in all directions. If the origin (the 0th hexagon) or the destination (a 6th hexagon) is violet in colour, then the entire field of violet hexagons is considered one field / within the zone of validity.</p>
<p>Luxembourgish tickets sold by the Luxembourgish <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank"><em>Verkéiersverbond</em></a> has a slightly wider range than CFL. For instance, they sell <em>carnets</em> (bundles of 5/10 tickets for the price of 4/8).</p>

<p>The Luxembourgish <em>Verkéiersverbond</em> has a website <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/" target="_blank">mobiliteit.lu</a> that gives information regarding all forms of public transport in Luxembourg. There is a journey planner app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cdt" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mobiliteit-lu/id434829995?mt=8&ls=1" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="http://mobiliteitszentral.hafas.de/hafas/mz/detect.exe/d?processRedirect" target="_blank">symbian/BlackBerry</a>), and a separate mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets.</p>	  
	  
	  
	  <p>Mirroring the complexity of the Belgian railway network, there is a myriad of ticketing options in Belgium. Here I will only introduce the most-commonly encountered ticketing issues.</p>
	      <h4 id="channels-of-purchase">Channels of purchase</h4> 
	      <h5>International tickets</h4>
	      <p>The user interface of NMBS/SNCB International's <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a> and  app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>) are basically the same. Other than inputting the 'from' and 'to' stations, you can also input a 'via' station. If it can compute your route, it gives you a list of possible routes. You choose one of them, it shows you the details of the journey, and ticket conditions. You press 'book' for the journey that you want to book. You then input your personal details. The payment methods are Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express, PayPal, Bancontact (Belgian debit card), and iDEAL (Dutch bank transfer). If payment is successful, a ticket is issued. For most destinations, an e-ticket is delivered. See <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Delivery" target="_blank">ticket delivery methods</a>.</p>
	      <p>Some ticket offices/counters can handle international tickets. In 20+ stations, they offer the full range of international tickets offered by NMBS/SNCB International. In another 20+ stations, they can handle tickets to destination(s) directly reachable from there (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of such stations). Other than purchasing tickets at a ticket counter, tickets can also be purchased via telephone. For ticket purchase at a ticket counter or via telephone, in many cases they charge a service fee of €5/€9/€14 (see <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ServiceFee" target="_blank">here</a>). Tickets purchased via telephone, or tickets purchased online that cannot be delivered as an e-ticket, can be picked up for free at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#PickupStations" target="_blank">48 Belgian stations and 6 Dutch stations</a>. (For tickets that can be issued as an e-ticket, but you choose to pick it up at a station, there is a handling fee of €6.)</p>
	      <p>The range of international tickets that Belgian ticket machines can handle is very small, and all of them are 'just across the border'. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a>.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic tickets via the NMBS/SNCB app</h5>
<p>At the NMBS/SNCB domestic app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), you start by using the journey planner. If you press a suggested journey that is purely domestic, and involves only trains, at the bottom of the suggestion is a button which says 'buy ticket'. Check the details of the ticket: Product (i.e. <a href="#types-of-tickets">ticket type</a>), From, To, Number of passengers (1 to 6), Date, Type/Class (single/return/1st class/2nd class). 'Via' is not possible with Belgian domestic tickets; breaking of journey is allowed, but if you make a detour, you have to buy two separate tickets (see <a href="#breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">below</a>). Pressing tick on the top right corner gets you to a confirmation screen; price is also given on the same screen. Press tick again, and you'll have to input the personal details of the principle traveller: first name, last name, date of birth, and e-mail address. Methods of payment are Visa, Mastercard, American Express. Only credit cards are accepted. When the transaction is succesful, the ticket is stored in the app. You have to show the mobile ticket from the app in a smart phone, or tablet computer, when asked by a train conductor. The principle traveller also has to be ready to show their ID; the personal details of the principle traveller in the ticket has to match that in their ID.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets via the NMBS/SNCB website</h5>
	      <p>At the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB domestic website</a>, you can start by using the journey planner. After it gives you suggested itinieraries, there is a 'buy ticket' button at the bottom. (Alternatively, press <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> directly to their ticketing page. Or try their <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new ticketing page</a>.) You then have to fill in the journey details and the personal details of the traveller. In contrast to the app, which is only for domestic journeys, the website can also handle tickets on NMBS/SNCB trains to Aachen, Roosendaal, and Maastricht. (Maastricht Randwyck and Eijsden cost the same as Maastricht.) In the <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">ticketing page</a>, in the 'Ticket' drop-down list, select 'TICKET AACHEN', 'TICKET ROOSENDAAL', or 'TICKET MAASTRICHT' instead of the usual options like 'STANDARD TICKET'. (On the other hand, with the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new ticketing page</a>, you can just input Aachen, Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, or Eijsden as the origin/destination.) The range of payment accepted are:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Card: Mastercard, Bancontact, BNP Paribas Fortis, American Express, Visa</li>
		      <li>Belgian bank transfer: ING, Belfius, KBC, CBC</li>
	      </ul>
<p>After a successful transaction, an e-ticket is delivered as a pdf, which you have to print out. Alternatively, for a purely domestic journey, Belgians can choose to have the e-ticket recorded electronically in their Belgian national ID card; you input the ID card number before payment.</p>
	      <h5>Domestic and cross-border tickets via Belgian ticket machines and ticket counters</h5>
	      <p>There are ticket machines at all Belgian stations. In the Netherlands and Germany, there are Belgian ticket machines at Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Aachen Hauptbahnhof (but apparently not in Eijsden). You can choose from English, German, French, or Dutch language at the ticket machines. They take Visa, Bancontact (Belgian cards), MasterCard, Maestro, and American Express. Some also take coins.</p>
	      </p>They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., internet-only tickets). The range of international tickets that they sell is very limited: tickets to Aachen Hbf, Roosendaal, or Maastricht on NMBS/SNCB trains can be bought from any ticket machines in Belgium; tickets for Lille on NMBS/SNCB trains, and 'anywhere in Luxembourg' tickets, can only be bought in their respective border regions. See <a href="#cross-border">below</a> on the conditions of these tickets. The Belgian ticket machines in the Netherlands and Germany have a somewhat restricted range of tickets on offer. For instance, the NMBS/SNCB Rail Pass, which is not valid outside Belgium, is apparently not sold there.</p>	      
	  <p>Some stations have ticket counters. They sell nearly the whole range of domestic tickets (except, e.g., internet-only tickets). The ticket counters at <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#InternationalStations" target="_blank">these stations</a> can sell international tickets.

	      <h5>Tickets purchased from NMBS/SNCB train conductors, and fines</h5>
	      <p>Buying tickets on board NMBS/SNCB trains incurs a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/on-board-fare.aspx" target="_blank">fee of €7</a>, unless:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>you buy your ticket onboard an NMBS/SNCB train while it is not in Belgium. (Not including the Brussels – Amsterdam/The Hague IC; if you travel in a train without a valid ticket in the Netherlands, you will probably get a fine of €50.)</li>
		      <li>you buy a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee-to-airport.aspx" target="_blank">diabolo fee</a> (Brussels Airport-Zaventem station access fee; €5.3).</li>

	      <p>See also other exemptions in their <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/boordtarief.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
	      <p>Go to a train conductor before they come to you. If you fail to buy a ticket on board, you will get a fine of €75 in Belgium. (I don't know what rules apply if you're in an NMBS/SNCB train in a neighbouring country. For instance, the usual Luxembourgish fine is €150.)</p>
	      <p>The ticket that you get from a train conductor is an <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/FAQ/ticket-on-the-train.aspx" target="_blank">RFID ticket</a> (contactless). If you need a receipt, or need to read the data of an RFID ticket issued to you, you can tap that ticket on the card reader at a Belgian ticket machine. An RFID ticket cannot be used to travel from Belgium to a neighbouring country.</p>
	      <h4 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets: domestic and cross-border</h4>
	      <p>There is a plethora of ticket types sold by NMBS/SNCB for domestic and short-distance cross-border journeys. (Things are complicated, but it is because there are many good deals.) Here I will only introduce some common ones for domestic trips.</p>

	      <li>There is a range of tickets to <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/aachen.aspx" target="_blank">Aachen Hbf</a> in Germany, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/roosendaal.aspx" target="_blank">Roosendaal</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/maastricht.aspx" target="_blank">Maastricht</a> in the Netherlands (Maastricht Randwyck and Eijsden cost the same as Maastricht). Ticket machines in Belgium and the NMBS/SNCB website can handle tickets to/from these stations. (But not the NMBS/SNCB app!) There are also Belgian ticket machines at these stations in Germany and the Netherlands (apparently except Eijsden). However the range of tickets available in these ticket machines is somewhat smaller (e.g. the Rail Pass is apparently not available). In the <a href="https://www.belgianrail.be/en/timetable-and-buy-tickets/Search/secure/buy-your-ticket-step-1.aspx" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a>, you need to choose from the 'Ticket' drop-down list the option of TICKETS AACHEN, TICKETS ROOSENDAAL, or TICKETS MAASTRICHT, and not the usual options like STANDARD TICKET. In the <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">new NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a>, you just need to input Aachen, Roosendaal, Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, or Eijsden as the 'from' or 'to' station. (It is apparently not possible to book tickets between these.) The domestic <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/groups/pet-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Pet Ticket</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bike.aspx" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> are also valid on these NMBS/SNCB services. A ticket from the border to Aachen/Roosendaal/Maastricht can be used back-to-back with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train. For instance, you can use a Rail Pass up till Hergenrath near the German border, and then present another ticket between Hergenrath and Aachen Hbf, while sitting in the same Belgian train.

	<h4 id="bicycles-and-pets">Bicycles and pets</h4>
<p>Folded up folding bicycles travel for free. Otherwise, for domestic travel and for Roosendaal/Maastricht/Aachen Hbf on NMBS/SNCB trains, a <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bike.aspx" target="_blank">Bike Ticket</a> (Fietsbiljet/Billet Vélo/Fahrradfahrkarte) is €5 for one-way, and €8 for a day ticket (dagkaart/carte 1 jour/Tageskarte). A bicycle ticket is not valid, i.e. bicycles are not allowed to board/deboard trains, at Brussels-Central, Brussels-Chapelle/-Kapellekerk, and Brussels-Congres. Bicycles are also not allowed on the Libramont – Bastogne NMBS/SNCB bus. See the domestic <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/stations-and-train/bike-on-the-train.aspx" target="_blank">bike on train</a> page, and the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Preparation#Bicycles" target="_blank">international FAQ</a>. (Ignore what the international page say about Aachen; when you buy a bicycle ticket for Aachen at Belgian Rail ticket machines or <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/search" target="_blank">website</a>, the domestic bicycle ticket is offered. But do check again.) NMBS/SNCB charges €13 for bicycle carriage on international non-high-speed trains, including those to Lille and Luxembourg. (On the other hand, for Luxembourg, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/loisir-et-tourisme/randonneurs-et-cyclistes" target="_blank">bicycles travel for free</a> in CFL trains and buses.)</p>

Free for animals in a container 55×30×30 cm not occupying a seat. Assistent animals also travel for free, but a free pass has to be processed through the assistent animal organisation. See the domestic <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/stations-and-train/travel-with-your-pets.aspx" target="_blank">Travel with your pet page</a>, and the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Preparation#Animals" target="_blank">international FAQ</a>.</p>
	<h4>Summary of purchase channels and ticket types</h4>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB provides this <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/customer-service/where-to-buy-my-tickets/buy-summary.aspx" target="_blank">summary table</a> for the various channels of purchase and types of tickets.</p>
<h4 id="international-ticketing">International ticketing</h4>
	  <p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone.</p>
	  <h5>Germany</h5>
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Aachen Hbf, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>. German local-tariff tickets are NOT valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf (see the <a href="netherlands.html#germany"> Germany section of the Netherlands page</a> for explanations).</p> 
	  <p>For ICE tickets between Belgium and Germany, with <em>Sparpreis Europa</em> saver fares, the price is the same to/from any Belgian train stations. Just input the actual origin and destination stations when booking an ICE ticket. See the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ICE_ABS" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International. (What NMBS/SNCB International says is actually not true: NMBS/SNCB is quite generous with the Sparpreis free distance that it gives from the ICE stations in Brussels and Liège, but for the western and southern extremities of Belgium, the Sparpreis can be bumped up by €10 or €20. If you are concerned about budget, it is best to compare the price for Brussels/Liège, and then find out at what point from Brussels/Liège the price is bumped up. The distance is not the same for all trains.)</p>  
	  <h5>The Netherlands</h5>	
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Roosendaal or Maastricht, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>.</p>
<p>For non-high-speed train tickets between Belgium and the Netherlands, there is an <em>online-only</em> discount (i.e. no discount from ticket machines/ticket counters!): a fixed discount is given (i.e. no need to book too early) if booked seven or more days ahead from the NMBS/SNCB or NS international websites or apps. The discount is on average 40&#37; off full-flex for trips on Monday to Thursday, and 20&#37; off for trips on Friday to Sunday. These discount tickets are mid-flex, i.e. it is refundable to a degree. (An exception is that with the NMBS/SNCB website/app, for travels just Belgium and Roosendaal/Maastricht, they automatically give you their better fixed-rate price. In general, if you have to go through Roosendaal or Maastricht, see whether getting Belgian tickets to Roosendaal/Maastricht and then domestic Dutch tickets from Roosendaal/Maastricht is a better deal.)</p>

	  <h5 id="luxembourg">Luxembourg</h5>  
	  <p>There is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the 'normal' tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International or CFL.</p>
    	  <p>There is a range of DAY RETURN tickets for short-distance cross-border traffic between <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium and any station in Luxembourg</a>. For the standard, child, and pet tickets (children and small pets usually travel for free), these day return tickets are only available at the ticket machines and ticket counters at:</p>
		<ul>
			      <li>Trois-Ponts, Vielsalm, and Gouvy, for journeys via the Gouvy frontier</li> 
			      <li>Arlon and Messancy, for journeys via the Sterpenich or Athus frontier</li>
			      <li>Virton, Halanzy, and Aubange, for journeys via the Athus frontier</li>
		</ul>
<p>(For Athus: Belgian domestic ticketing applies in Athus, and Luxembourgish ticketing is also extended to Athus for Luxembourgish trains/buses. At Athus you can get a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or the CFL train conductor. A 2-hour ticket costs €2/€3.) NOTE: all <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgian–Luxembourgish short-distance cross-border day return tickets</a> cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Luxembourg with a one of these special Luxembourg – Arlon ticket, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Arlon with a domestic Belgian ticket. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Luxembourg pass Arlon, or catch another train at Arlon. (Clauses for standard ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/CD78FD0FFC1442F5B364FF4BE15AC331.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/294B6201AFD240E2A3476BD9FB237630.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.) CFL issues exactly the same range of day return tickets from any station in Luxembourg to these nearby Belgian stations. They can be purchased at CFL ticket offices, or for Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts/Arlon, also from CFL ticket machines. They have the same rule on not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket.</p> 
	  <p>Otherwise you can get normal international tickets, from international ticket offices, NMBS/SNCB International website, or CFL website. A normal full-flex Arlon–Luxembourg one-way ticket costs just slightly less than a special day-return between Arlon and Luxembourg (while a normal full-flex return ticket is double the price of a one-way). Other than full-flex, there are also the mid-flex tickets of youth single or return (for people 25 years or younger), and weekend return (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun). There are also the no-flex return tickets called Escapade 1/2/3: for €52/74/96 second class, or €86/135/180 first class, a return ticket within 30 days for 1/2/3 people between any station in Belgium and any station in Luxembourg. With these normal international tickets, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>	
	  <h5 id="lille">Lille and further</h5>	
	  <p>For the Lille area, there is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the international tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International.</p> 
	<p>There are two special short-distance cross-border tickets for the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille.aspx" target="_blank">Lille area</a>: <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-1-day.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline 1 day ticket</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-season-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline subscription</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>Kortrijk and Zone Mouscron (Mouscron or Herseaux), for journeys via the Tourcoing frontier</li>
			<li>Tournai and Froyennes, for journeys via the Blandain frontier</li>
			<li>(But the tariff tables (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>) also list Tournai/Froynnes via Tourcoing as an option.)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Trampoline 1 day ticket gives unlimited travel for 1 day on NMBS/SNCB trains on the Kortrijk – Lille Flandres line, or the Tournai – Lille Flandres line, as indicated on the ticket. NOTE: the Trampoline ticket, and the Trampoline subscription, cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Lille Flandres with a Trampoline ticket to Kortrijk, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Kortrijk. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Lille-Flandres pass Kortrijk, or catch another train at Kortrijk. (Clauses of the Trampoline 1 day ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/BFE66B51C0744E9692559DE83CC8204B.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/42948454596E444898CA1E3BBA99DEFF.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.)</p>
	  <p>From anywhere in Belgium, there is a mid-flex return ticket called the Trampoline Weekend ticket to Lille Flandres (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), which is 40&#37; off the full-flex price. With this Trampoline Weekend ticket, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>  
	<p>For high-speed travel between Brussels-Midi/Zuid and Lille Europe, NMBS/SNCB International has a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#AboLille" target="_blank">Brussels–Lille subscription</a>, valid on all TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar services. This can be purchased at the international ticket office at Brussels-Midi/Zuid.</p>
	<p>An 'Any Belgian Station' (ABS) option is available for TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar. For a small fixed-price, a connecting journey on NMBS/SNCB trains can be added to a TGV, Thalys, or Eurostar journey. See the FAQ for <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Connection" target="_blank">TGV</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSThalys" target="_blank">Thalys</a>, and <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSEurostar" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International.</p>
	<h3 id="breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">Breaking, detours, zones, and fares</h3>
	<p>By default, you travel on the shortest possible route in distance between the 'from' and 'to' stations. In this case, you are allowed to break your journey: feel free to stop at an intermediate point, and join a later train to continue your journey. The ticket is valid until the last service of the day (you are responsible for checking whether there are still services that allow you to complete the journey).</p>
	<p>In some cases, you are allowed take a route that is not shortest in distance. However, in these circumstances, you are not allowed to break your journey (beyond making necessary train changes):</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you can get to your destination faster;</li>
	<li>if you can avoid changing trains, and can stay in the same train, and if this journey is maximally 30 minutes longer than taking the shortest route in distance;</li>
	<li>you can backtrack along a route if by doing that, you can get to your destination faster, or if there is no connection right at the point where the two tracks intersect, or if there is a delay.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Otherwise, you are not allowed to make a detour. If you want to make a detour, you have to purchase two spearate tickets. In the NMBS/SNCB journey planner, sometimes it gives you suggestions with a warning saying that you have to buy two separate tickets for the suggested journey.</p>
	<p id="Zone">Some stations are grouped together into 'Zones'. There are 21 such Zones in Belgium; the largest of which is the Brussels Zone, covering basically the same area as the Brussels-Capital Region. These zones are indicated in the maps above as pink polygons. Each of these Zones is a single tariff point. A tickets which has a Zone as its origin and/or destination gives the traveller, on the ticket's day of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until one leaves that Zone. (When purchasing a ticket, when you type in a station that is within a Zone, I think the resulting ticket automatically has the name of that Zone as the origin/destination.) In a Rail Pass or similar ticket, you can put down a Zone as the origin and/or destination. International rail tickets that depart from or arrives at a station within a Zone in Belgium also give the traveller free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains in that Zone until one leaves that Zone.</p>
	<p>A ticket with Mortsel, Mortsel-Liersesteenweg, Mortsel-Oude God, or Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg as its origin/destination has equal validity in the other three Mortsel stations. (However, Mortsel is not a Zone, e.g. a ticket to one of the Mortsel stations does not give limitless travel amongst the Mortsel stations.)</p>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB tickets to/from Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Eijsden cost the same, and are equality valid to the other two stations. (However, Maastricht is also not a Zone.)</p>
	<p>An NMBS/SNCB return ticket from anywhere in Belgium, Roosendaal, the Maastricht stations, or Aachen Hbf to a coastal station (kuststation / gare du littoral) allows the traveller to begin the return journey from another coastal station. The coastal stations are:
Knokke, Duinbergen, Heist, Zeebrugge-Dorp, Zeebrugge-Strand, Blankenberge, Oostende, Veurne, Koksijde, and De Panne. Basically the entire coast is linked by the <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/kusttram/" target="_blank"><em>Kusttram</em> 'Coastal Tram'</a>. Ticketing of <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a>, the Flemish public transport company, applies on the Coastal Tram.</p>
	<p>Most of the points above are mentioned in the NMBS/SNCB glossary (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/A8AFD75E2FF441D9A9006F27DD659F9C.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/F9C6D129540149058BE6E25B207616D9.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>).</p>
	<p>This is the tariff tables in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>. 1 to 3 km have the same fare. For normal tickets, distances longer than 150 km are charged 150 km.</p>

<h3 id="other-public-transport-operators">Other public transport operators</h3>
<p>From the customers' points of view, other than NMBS/SNCB, there are just three other public transport companies in Belgium:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a> (Flanders)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stib-mivb.be/index.htm?l=en" target="_blank">STIB-MIVB</a> (Brussels)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonia)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Their networks overlap a little bit. Many Belgian buses cross into neighbouring countries, and many foreign buses cross into Belgium.</p>
<p>NMBS/SNCB has <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bus-tram-metro.aspx" target="_blank">various subscriptions</a> that combine travels on their trains and each of these other three other public transport operators.</p>
<p>All four Belgian public transport operators use an RFID card called <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/mobib.aspx" target="_blank">MoBIB</a>. However, currently NMBS/SNCB and De Lijn only use (personalised) MoBIB cards for subscriptions; their use for the everyday tickets has not been introduced. (On the other hand, STIB-MIVB and TEC have flat-rate ordinary tickets that can be loaded into a personalised or anonymous MoBIB card.)</p>
