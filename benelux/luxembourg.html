<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Luxembourg (Luxembourgish <em>Lëtzebuerg</em>, French <em>Luxembourg</em>, German/Dutch <em>Luxemburg</em>). See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips about Luxembourg in that page are repeated here.</p>

	<p>Operators of non-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CFL (<em>Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois</em> 'National Company of the Luxembourgish Railways'; <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>. <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">International booking website for France</a>; <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">International booking website for other countries</a>): the Luxembourgish national railway company. Its network extends a little bit into Belgium and France, and a long way into Germany.</a>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Also runs coach services to <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Hbf</a> in Germany and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Lorraine TGV</a> in France.</li>
	      </ul></li>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx" target="_blank">domestic website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">international website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Belgian national railway company; runs all the way into Luxembourg City from the west and north:
	<ul>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs the InterCity services west to Namur/Brussels.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs some of the local services on the same line to Kleinbettingen/Arlon.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB and CFL jointly run the InterCity services north to Liège/Liers.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</em>: the regional branch of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail) in the Grand Est region of France; runs a TER (regional) service between Luxembourg and Merz or Nancy to the south.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operators:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail) (Luxembourg to Paris Est about 6 times per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Montpellier once per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Marseille once per day). Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Two OUIGO stations easily accessible from Luxembourg are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV to the south.</p>
	      <h3 id="types-of-train-services">Types of train services</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patters, there are various types of train services in Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish nomenclature for types of non-high-speed services is basically the same as German nomenclature (but in Luxembourgish).</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>RegionalBunn</em> (RB): all-stops service.</li>
	<li><em>Regional-Express</em> (RE): skips some stops.</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): usually only stops at larger stations.</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The InterCity to the west of Luxembourg City (Namur/Brussels) is run by NMBS/SNCB trains. On the same line, the RE/RB between Luxembourg and Kleinbettingen/Arlon is run by CFL trains or NMBS/SNCB trains. The InterCity to the north of Luxembourg City (Liège/Liers) is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB (often CFL locomotive with NMBS/SNCB carriages.) To the east of Luxembourg City, CFL runs an RE per hour to Trier Hbf and Koblenz Hbf. In Germany this service is called the RE 11. Once per day, the CFL RE 11 continues further from Koblenz Hbf, and becomes an IC to Bonn Hbf, Köln Hbf (i.e. Cologne), and Düsseldorf Hbf. (CFL's RE 11 train is often coupled with DB Regio Südwest's RE 1 train between Koblenz Hbf and Trier Hbf: after arriving at Trier Hbf from Koblenz Hbf, they are decoupled; RE 11 continues to Luxembourg, while RE 1 continues to Saarbrücken Hbf and Mannheim Hbf.)</p>
	  <p>For French trains in Luxembourg, French nomenclature is also used:</p>
	  <li><em>Transport express régional</em> (TER): SNCF's brand of regional trains. They can be all-stops, or more like an RE. Some can travel very far. They make more stops than <em>Intercités</em>.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a>: SNCF's high-speed rail service.</li>
<p>The following are network maps of the regular passenger rail services in Luxembourg and Belgium.</p>

	  <p>'P train' is a Belgian nomenclature for supplementary services (primarily added services during peak-hours). These services in Luxembourg are classified as RB, RE, or IC, based primarily on their stopping pattern in Luxembourg. (But they do have the same train number in both countries.)</p>

	  <h4>Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h4>
	  <p>The Luxembourgish public transport system is coordinated through the Luxembourgish <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>. There is the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/" target="_blank">mobiliteit.lu</a> website that gives information regarding all forms of public transport in Luxembourg. There is a mobiliteit.lu journey planner app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cdt" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mobiliteit-lu/id434829995?mt=8&ls=1" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="http://mobiliteitszentral.hafas.de/hafas/mz/detect.exe/d?processRedirect" target="_blank">symbian/BlackBerry</a>), and a separate mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. (But the mTicket app never worked on my phone; I used the CFL app.)</p>
  	  <p>For domestic and some cross-border traffic, Luxembourg has a unified time-based ticketing system for basically all forms of public transport. Other than domestic train travel in Luxembourg, the tickets also cover the buses and trams of Luxembourgish bus/tram companies: <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/" target="_blank">AVL</a> (Luxembourg City bus), a href="http://www.tice.lu/en" target="_blank">TICE</a> (Southwest/Esch-sur-Alzette area bus), RGTR (countrywide bus), <a href="http://www.luxtram.lu/" target="_blank">Luxtram</a>.</p> 
<h5>Types of tickets</h5>
<p>The range of Luxembourgish tickets advertised on the websties/apps of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">CFL</a>, <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs" target="_blank">AVL</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank"><em>Verkéiersverbond</em></a> are slightly different, but they are the same Luxembourgish tickets. The most common Luxembourgish tickets are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Short time ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Kuerzzäitbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet courte durée</em>), €2 second class, €3 first class: two hours validity from validation.</li>
	<li>Day ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Dagesbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet longue durée 1 jour</em>, €4 second calss, €6 first class: valid from validation till 04:00 the following day.</li>
	<li>1 day group ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Gruppenbilljee 1 Dag</em>, French <em>Billet de groupe longue durée 1 jour</em>, €12 second class: ticket for 5 people, valid from validation till 04:00 the following day.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are the <em>carnets</em>: bundles of 10 short time tickets for the price of 8, or 5 day tickets for the price of 4. There are also 2 and 3 day versions of the 1 day tickets; their costs are just multiples of the 1 day tickets.</p>
<p>These Luxembourgish tickets give unlimited transfers amongst the modes of public transport where these tickets are valid (see <a href="#validity-area">above</a>). Passengers have to leave the train/bus/tram before the ticket expires, based on the timetable schedule of that train/bus/tram service. (Fine for not having a valid public transport ticket in Luxembourg is €150.)</p>
<p>Other than these 2-hour and day tickets, there are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-mensuels" target="_blank">monthly</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels" target="_blank">annual</a> subscriptions. With the monthly and annual subscriptions, there is an 'entire network' option, and a 'short distance' option. With the 'short distnace' option, you have to nominate an origin and a destination. In the clauses of the 'short distance' subscriptions is a hexagon map (the monthly and annual subscription hexagon maps look different); 'short distance' is maximally six hexagons away from a centre point. If the origin (the 0th hexagon) or the destination (a 6th hexagon) is coloured, then the entire field of coloured hexagons is considered one field / within the zone of validity.</p>
<p>With RégioZone 1 and RégioZone 2 (see <a href="#validity-area">below</a>), there are short time tickets, day tickets, monthly subscriptions, and anuual subscriptions.</p>
<p>There is the <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/citykaart" target="_blank">Citykaart</a>, a monthly subscription that is valid for all AVL buses, Luxtram, and some RGTR and CFL trains in Luxembourg City; see the validity map there.</p>
<p>There are yet other Luxembourgish tickets: see <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5 id="validity-area">Validity area of Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h5>
<p>For trains, the domestic tickets cover travels between any train station within Luxembourg. For these stations right across from the border:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France are only served by CFL, and are disconnected from the French passenger rail network (physically, and also not bookable through the SNCF website). These two stations are listed like other domestic stations in CFL's <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/gares-et-services/nos-gares" target="_blank">list of stations</a>, and they have Luxembourgish ticket machines. I suppose Luxembourgish domestic tickets apply at these two stations, but you should ask.</li>
		<li>Athus in Belgium is considered the same tariff point as Rodange in Luxembourg. In other words, Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus. However, there are no CFL ticket machines at Athus. (I asked CFL about these two points.) At Athus, you can purchase a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or mTicket app. You can also buy a Luxembourgish ticket from a CFL train conductor; purchasing train tickets from a CFL train conductor incurs a surcharge of €1.</li>
</ul>
<p>For buses, domestic Luxembourgish tickets are valid on Luxembourgish bus destinations to some closest-by international localities. For further localities, there is a <em>RégioZone 1</em> and <em>RégioZone 2</em> tariff levels. (RégioZone 1 includes travel in RégioZone 1 and the domestic zone, while RégioZone 2 includes travel in RégioZone 2, RégioZone 1, and domestic zone.) See <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers/regiozone" target="_blank">this page</a>, and the attachements (a list and a map) towards the bottom of that page for localities in Belgium, France, and Germany where each of the three levels of tariff applies.</p>
<p>Normal Luxembourgish tickets are valid on the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Express</a> bus to Saarbrücken Hbf (RégioZone 2 tariff applies). Luxembourgish tariff is also valid on RGTR bus lines crossing into Belgium/France/Germany; RGTR bus lines can be run by Luxembourgish buses, or foreign buses. On the other hand, Luxembourighs tickets are NOT valid on <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonian Belgian) buses. (However, <a href="https://www.infotec.be/fr-be/acheteruntitre/titresettarifs/abonnements.aspx" target="_blank">TEC subscriptions</a> from TEC Namur-Luxembourg <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers" target="_blank">are valid</a> on AVL and RGTR buses.)</p>
<p>Some monthly and annual subscriptions have a restricted geogrpahical range; see above.</p> 
<h5>Channels of purchase and ticket media</h5>
<p>Luxembourgish mobile phone numbers can <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/sms4ticket" target="_blank">text <em>A</em> to 64222</a> for a 2-hour ticket through SMS. €2 for the ticket, and €0.25 for the SMS. Tickets are validated immediately.</p>
<p>The basic tickets can be purchased from a bus driver or train conductor. All tickets bought from a train conductor has a €1 surcharge. Tickets are validated immediately.</p>
<p>There are the CFL app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), and the mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. (But the mTicket app never worked on my phone.) The CFL app takes Visa and Mastercard. The mTicket app takes DIGICASH (Luxembourgish bank transfer) and PayPal. With the CFL app, individual tickets, or the first ticket in a carnet, is validated immediately; the rest of the tickets in a carnet has to be validated in the app before usage. With the monthly network subscriptions (1st or 2nd class), one can choose the starting date of the subscription.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/bornes-automatiques" target="_blank">CFL ticket machines</a> at all train stations in Luxembourg, at Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France, but apparently not in Athus in Belgium and other foreign stations served by CFL. The CFL ticket machines sell domestic tickets, and also some cross-border return tickets (see <a href="#cross-border">below</a>). You can switch between English, Luxembourgish, French, and German languages in the machines. The machines takes coins, and some cards (Vpay, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro). Very few machines take bank notes. Tickets are validated immediately after purchase.</p>
<p>From some many ticket counters and (non-CFL) ticket machines, Luxembourgish tickets are issued into an <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart" target="_blank"><em>mKaart</em></a>, which is Luxembourg's contactless RFID card. The card itself it issued for free when purchased with a ticket, and the card has a validity of five years. Tickets and subscriptions can be loaded into an mKaart. This is the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/sites/default/files/layout-block/files/mkaart-guide-web.pdf" target="_blank">User Guide</a> (May 2017). To validate a ticket: a) if there is just one ticket/carnet in the card, just tap the card on the card reader, and that ticket is validated; b) if there are multiple tickets/carnets in the card, tap the card on the card reader, the screen then displays the tickets that the card has in it, you press the touchscreen for the ticket that you want to validate, and then you have to tap the card on the card reader again; c) if you want to validate multiple tickets, e.g., if the card is used by two people using two separate tickets in the card at the same time, repeat the procedures in b).</p>
<p>If you already have an mKaart, you can go to the <a href="https://mshop.lu/SetLang?lang=en" target="_blank">mShop</a> website, set up an account / log into your account, and purchase Luxembourgish public transport tickets there. However: a) tickets ordered online are only available after 04:00 the next day; b) the tickets are not loaded automatically in an mKaart; <a href="https://mshop.lu/pages/pickup" target="_blank">you have to</a> go to a validator, press the circular red button on the top left corner of the touch screen, and then hold the card on the card reader until the tickets are loaded into the card.</p>
<p>The <em>Verkéiersverbond</em> has their ticket offices, the <em>Mobilitéitszentral</em>, at Luxembourg and Belval-Université stations. CFL has ticket offices at <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/vente-en-gare" target="_blank">ten stations</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cross-border">Special cross-border deals</h4>
<p>For all of these tickets/subscriptions, read the clauses very carefully, as international train travel involves unpredictable interactions between rules of different countries. I might not have portrayed all the necessary rules, and hopefully I have not misunderstood the clauses written in French.</p>
<h5>Belgium</h5>
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/belgique-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> between any station in Luxembourg and some closer-by stations in Belgium. For the day return tickets (TGL = all Luxembourgish stations), tickets for the following options are available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>TGL – Arlon/Messancy via Sterpenich frontier</li>
	<li>TGL – Messancy/Arlon via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Aubange/Halanzy/Virton via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
	<li>Troisvierges – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
</ul>
<p>CFL ticket machines only sell these special return ticket tickets to Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts, and for 'Arlon via Sterpenich' and 'Arlon via Athus'. Tickets for Arlon via either route costs the same (in 2018), but since railway companies are most usually very particular about which frontier point passengers cross international borders, you should not mix these two routes and their corresponding tickets up. The other destinations cost the same as Arlon, except for Virton, and Messancy via Sterpenich, both of which are more expensive. (Please ask whether you can you an 'Arlon via Athus' ticket for Halanzy/Aubange/Messancy via Athus.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> has a range a bit further in Belgium, and includes other public transport in Luxembourg. One commonality between these special-priced tickets/subscription is that <em>they cannot be combined with another Belgian domestic ticket on the same train</em>. For instance, do not board the IC from Luxembourg to Arlon on one of these special day return tickets, and then stay on the same train beyond Arlon with a Belgian domestic ticket. (On the other hand, if you have a full-fare Luxembourg &gt; Arlon ticket, there seems to be no such rule. But, please still ask first.)</p>
<p>The exact same range of tickets/subscriptions are also offered by NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail) in the reverse order, with the same rules about not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train.</p>
<h5>France</h5>
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/luxembourg-lorraine-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> from any station in Luxembourg to Thionville/Metz/Nancy via Bettembourg frontier on TER trains (not TGV). These tickets are also sold from CFL ticket machines. Tickets are not sold in the other direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there seems to be no special tickets to Longwy and beyond. When buying an international ticket, just get a domestic ticket, and then an international ticket between Rodange and Longwy. (And that short international section is quite expensive. Getting an international ticket all the way from Luxembourg City to Longwy is horrendously expensive. If you have time, just catch a RGTR bus between Rodange and Longwy; it is covered by domestic Luxembourgish tickets.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/le-pass-luxembourg-hebdomadaire" target="_blank">weekly</a>, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexway" target="_blank">monthly</a>, and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexjunior" target="_blank">monthly for youth</a> subscriptions. These cover all train stations in Luxembourg and till a certain point on the line towards Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier (not TGV), and also to Longwy via the Rodange frontier. The monthly subscriptions also cover other forms of public transport in Luxembourg. For departure from Luxembourg, these subscriptions can be purchased by anyone in Luxembourg, but in the other direction, they can only be purchased by residents of Lorraine (the French region south of Luxembourg).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Gare Lorraine Express</a> (to the station of Lorraine TGV) has tickets of its own, and they must be pre-booked.</p>
<h5>Germany</h5>
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> from any (predefined) station in Luxembourg to Trier, or just from Wasserbillig to Trier. This ticket can be bought at ticket machines, and also from the CFL app. Separate outbound and inbound tickets are issued, and they need to be presented together. <em>Les titres doivent être agrafés</em> 'the tickets need to be stapled (?)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/allemagne/oekocard-wittlich-luxemburg" target="_blank">monthly/annual subscriptions</a> along this line to as far as Wittlich.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Express</a> bus is covered by Luxembourgish RégioZone 2 tickets (see above).</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/titres-de-transport-pour-voyageurs-en-groupe" target="_blank">this</a> for group tickets (six or more people).</p>
<p>For one to five people, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/rheinland-pfalz-ticket-plus-lu" target="_blank">Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket Lux</a>, which costs €30/36/42/48/54 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for a day, covering: a) in Luxembourg, the CFL domestic railway network; b) railway across the Igel frontier; c) in the German states of <em>Rheinland-Pfalz</em> (Rhineland-Palatinate) and <em>Saarland</em> (plus some bordering regions), local trains (IRE/RE/RB/S-bahn) and bus/trams. (See the validity area and other rules in the clauses. Read them very carefully.) The names of the holders have to be written on the ticket. This ticket can be purchased from the CFL ticket machines.</p>
<h5>France and Germany</h5>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering the local trains in Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (See the validity area and other rules in the clauses. Rad them very carefully.)</p>

<h4 id="international-ticketing">International ticketing</h4>



<p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="belgium.html#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone.</p>
	  <h5>Germany</h5>
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Aachen Hbf, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>. German local-tariff tickets are NOT valid on the NMBS/SNCB line to Aachen Hbf (see the <a href="netherlands.html#germany"> Germany section of the Netherlands page</a> for explanations).</p> 
	  <p>For ICE tickets between Belgium and Germany, with <em>Sparpreis Europa</em> saver fares, the price is the same to/from any Belgian train stations. Just input the actual origin and destination stations when booking an ICE ticket. See the <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ICE_ABS" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International. (What NMBS/SNCB International says is actually not true: NMBS/SNCB is quite generous with the Sparpreis free distance that it gives from the ICE stations in Brussels and Liège, but for the western and southern extremities of Belgium, the Sparpreis can be bumped up by €10 or €20. If you are concerned about budget, it is best to compare the price for Brussels/Liège, and then find out at what point from Brussels/Liège the price is bumped up. The distance is not the same for all trains.)</p>  
	  <h5>The Netherlands</h5>	
	  <p>For the NMBS/SNCB local train services to Roosendaal or Maastricht, see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>.</p>
<p>For non-high-speed train tickets between Belgium and the Netherlands, there is an <em>online-only</em> discount (i.e. no discount from ticket machines/ticket counters!): a fixed discount is given (i.e. no need to book too early) if booked seven or more days ahead from the NMBS/SNCB or NS international websites or apps. The discount is on average 40&#37; off full-flex for trips on Monday to Thursday, and 20&#37; off for trips on Friday to Sunday. These discount tickets are mid-flex, i.e. it is refundable to a degree. (An exception is that with the NMBS/SNCB website/app, for travels just Belgium and Roosendaal/Maastricht, they automatically give you their better fixed-rate price. In general, if you have to go through Roosendaal or Maastricht, see whether getting Belgian tickets to Roosendaal/Maastricht and then domestic Dutch tickets from Roosendaal/Maastricht is a better deal.)</p>

	</ul>
	  <h5 id="luxembourg">Luxembourg</h5>  
	  <p>There is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the 'normal' tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International or CFL.</p>
    	  <p>There is a range of DAY RETURN tickets for short-distance cross-border traffic between <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgium and any station in Luxembourg</a>. For the standard, child, and pet tickets (children and small pets usually travel for free), these day return tickets are only available at the ticket machines and ticket counters at:</p>
		<ul>
			      <li>Trois-Ponts, Vielsalm, and Gouvy, for journeys via the Gouvy frontier</li> 
			      <li>Arlon and Messancy, for journeys via the Sterpenich or Athus frontier</li>
			      <li>Virton, Halanzy, and Aubange, for journeys via the Athus frontier</li>
		</ul>
<p>(For Athus: Belgian domestic ticketing applies in Athus, and Luxembourgish ticketing is also extended to Athus for Luxembourgish trains/buses. At Athus you can get a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or the CFL train conductor. A 2-hour ticket costs €2/€3.) NOTE: all <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg.aspx" target="_blank">Belgian–Luxembourgish short-distance cross-border day return tickets</a> cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Luxembourg with a one of these special Luxembourg – Arlon ticket, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Arlon with a domestic Belgian ticket. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Luxembourg pass Arlon, or catch another train at Arlon. (Clauses for standard ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/CD78FD0FFC1442F5B364FF4BE15AC331.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/luxembourg/~/media/294B6201AFD240E2A3476BD9FB237630.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.) CFL issues exactly the same range of day return tickets from any station in Luxembourg to these nearby Belgian stations. They can be purchased at CFL ticket offices, or for Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts/Arlon, also from CFL ticket machines. They have the same rule on not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket.</p> 
	  <p>Otherwise you can get normal international tickets, from international ticket offices, NMBS/SNCB International website, or CFL website. A normal full-flex Arlon–Luxembourg one-way ticket costs just slightly less than a special day-return between Arlon and Luxembourg (while a normal full-flex return ticket is double the price of a one-way). Other than full-flex, there are also the mid-flex tickets of youth single or return (for people 25 years or younger), and weekend return (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun). There are also the no-flex return tickets called Escapade 1/2/3: for €52/74/96 second class, or €86/135/180 first class, a return ticket within 30 days for 1/2/3 people between any station in Belgium and any station in Luxembourg. With these normal international tickets, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>	
	  <h5 id="lille">Lille and further</h5>	
	  <p>For the Lille area, there is a distinction between the special short-distance cross-border tickets, and the international tickets issued by the NMBS/SNCB International.</p> 
	<p>There are two special short-distance cross-border tickets for the <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille.aspx" target="_blank">Lille area</a>: <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-1-day.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline 1 day ticket</a>, and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-season-ticket.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline subscription</a>. The <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/trampoline-1-day.aspx" target="_blank">Trampoline 1 day ticket</a> is only available at the ticket machines and ticket counters at:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Kortrijk and Zone Mouscron (Mouscron or Herseaux), for journeys via the Tourcoing frontier</li>
			<li>Tournai and Froyennes, for journeys via the Blandain frontier</li>
			<li>(But the tariff tables (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>) also list Tournai/Froynnes via Tourcoing as an option.)</li>
		</ul>
<p>A Trampoline 1 day ticket gives unlimited travel for 1 day on NMBS/SNCB trains on the Kortrijk – Lille Flandres line, or the Tournai – Lille Flandres line, as indicated on the ticket. NOTE: the Trampoline ticket, and the Trampoline subscription, cannot be used back-to-back with a domestic Belgian ticket in the same train! For instance, DO NOT board the IC from Lille Flandres with a Trampoline ticket to Kortrijk, AND THEN remain in the same train pass Kortrijk. You are meant to buy an international ticket from Lille-Flandres pass Kortrijk, or catch another train at Kortrijk. (Clauses of the Trampoline 1 day ticket in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/BFE66B51C0744E9692559DE83CC8204B.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/abroad/lille/~/media/42948454596E444898CA1E3BBA99DEFF.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>.)</p>
	  <p>From anywhere in Belgium, there is a mid-flex return ticket called the Trampoline Weekend ticket to Lille Flandres (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), which is 40&#37; off the full-flex price. With this Trampoline Weekend ticket, I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>  
	<p>For high-speed travel between Brussels-Midi/Zuid and Lille Europe, NMBS/SNCB International has a <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#AboLille" target="_blank">Brussels–Lille subscription</a>, valid on all TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar services. This can be purchased at the international ticket office at Brussels-Midi/Zuid.</p>
	<p>An 'Any Belgian Station' (ABS) option is available for TGV, Thalys, and Eurostar. For a small fixed-price, a connecting journey on NMBS/SNCB trains can be added to a TGV, Thalys, or Eurostar journey. See the FAQ for <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#Connection" target="_blank">TGV</a>, <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSThalys" target="_blank">Thalys</a>, and <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Questions/Tickets#ABSEurostar" target="_blank">Eurostar</a> on this from NMBS/SNCB International.</p>
	<h3 id="breaking-detours-zones-and-fares">Breaking, detours, zones, and fares</h3>
	<p>By default, you travel on the shortest possible route in distance between the 'from' and 'to' stations. In this case, you are allowed to break your journey: feel free to stop at an intermediate point, and join a later train to continue your journey. The ticket is valid until the last service of the day (you are responsible for checking whether there are still services that allow you to complete the journey).</p>
	<p>In some cases, you are allowed take a route that is not shortest in distance. However, in these circumstances, you are not allowed to break your journey (beyond making necessary train changes):</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you can get to your destination faster;</li>
	<li>if you can avoid changing trains, and can stay in the same train, and if this journey is maximally 30 minutes longer than taking the shortest route in distance;</li>
	<li>you can backtrack along a route if by doing that, you can get to your destination faster, or if there is no connection right at the point where the two tracks intersect, or if there is a delay.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Otherwise, you are not allowed to make a detour. If you want to make a detour, you have to purchase two spearate tickets. In the NMBS/SNCB journey planner, sometimes it gives you suggestions with a warning saying that you have to buy two separate tickets for the suggested journey.</p>
	<p id="Zone">Some stations are grouped together into 'Zones'. There are 21 such Zones in Belgium; the largest of which is the Brussels Zone, covering basically the same area as the Brussels-Capital Region. These zones are indicated in the maps above as pink polygons. Each of these Zones is a single tariff point. A tickets which has a Zone as its origin and/or destination gives the traveller, on the ticket's day of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until one leaves that Zone. (When purchasing a ticket, when you type in a station that is within a Zone, I think the resulting ticket automatically has the name of that Zone as the origin/destination.) In a Rail Pass or similar ticket, you can put down a Zone as the origin and/or destination. International rail tickets that depart from or arrives at a station within a Zone in Belgium also give the traveller free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains in that Zone until one leaves that Zone.</p>
	<p>A ticket with Mortsel, Mortsel-Liersesteenweg, Mortsel-Oude God, or Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg as its origin/destination has equal validity in the other three Mortsel stations. (However, Mortsel is not a Zone, e.g. a ticket to one of the Mortsel stations does not give limitless travel amongst the Mortsel stations.)</p>
	<p>NMBS/SNCB tickets to/from Maastricht, Maastricht Randwyck, and Eijsden cost the same, and are equality valid to the other two stations. (However, Maastricht is also not a Zone.)</p>
	<p>An NMBS/SNCB return ticket from anywhere in Belgium, Roosendaal, the Maastricht stations, or Aachen Hbf to a coastal station (kuststation / gare du littoral) allows the traveller to begin the return journey from another coastal station. The coastal stations are:
Knokke, Duinbergen, Heist, Zeebrugge-Dorp, Zeebrugge-Strand, Blankenberge, Oostende, Veurne, Koksijde, and De Panne. Basically the entire coast is linked by the <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/kusttram/" target="_blank"><em>Kusttram</em> 'Coastal Tram'</a>. Ticketing of <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a>, the Flemish public transport company, applies on the Coastal Tram.</p>
	<p>Most of the points above are mentioned in the NMBS/SNCB glossary (<a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/A8AFD75E2FF441D9A9006F27DD659F9C.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a>, <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/F9C6D129540149058BE6E25B207616D9.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>).</p>
	<p>This is the tariff tables in <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/klantendienst/~/media/9F7D9C1850AA40708DD0B636666F02AE.pdf" target="_blank">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/~/media/785C5285FDB8410EB64B629BB3DC772D.pdf" target="_blank">French</a>. 1 to 3 km have the same fare.

<p>From the customers' points of view, other than NMBS/SNCB, there are just three other public transport companies in Belgium:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/" target="_blank">De Lijn</a> (Flanders)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stib-mivb.be/index.htm?l=en" target="_blank">STIB-MIVB</a> (Brussels)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonia)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Their networks overlap a little bit. Many Belgian buses cross into neighbouring countries, and many foreign buses cross into Belgium.</p>
<p>NMBS/SNCB has <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/tickets-railcards/intermodal/train-bus-tram-metro.aspx" target="_blank">various subscriptions</a> that combine travels on their trains and each of these other three other public transport operators.</p>
<p>All four Belgian public transport operators use an RFID card called <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/travel-tickets/mobib.aspx" target="_blank">MoBIB</a>. However, currently NMBS/SNCB and De Lijn only use (personalised) MoBIB cards for subscriptions; their use for the everyday tickets has not been introduced. (On the other hand, STIB-MIVB and TEC have flat-rate ordinary tickets that can be loaded into a personalised or anonymous MoBIB card.)</p>
