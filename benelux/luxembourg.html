<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on train travel in/to/from/through Luxembourg. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips on Luxembourg in that page are repeated here.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is <em>Lëtzebuerg</em> in Luxembourgish, <em>Luxembourg</em> in French, and <em>Luxemburg</em> in German and Dutch. Often also referred as the <em>Grand Duchy</em> / <em>Groussherzogtum</em> / <em>Grand-Duché</em> / <em>Großherzogtum</em>. Other than the Grand Duchy, there is also the Province of Luxembourg in neighbouring Belgium, which was historically a part of the Grand Duchy. The primary train station in the Grand Duchy is the Luxembourg Station, in the capital city Luxembourg City.</p>	      
<h3 id="passenger-rail-service-operators">Passenger rail service operators</h3>
<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Luxembourg. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Luxembourg (plus the Netherlands and Belgium; Luxembourg is LU in the map).</p>

	      <ul>
		      <li>Also runs coach services to <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Hbf</a> in Germany and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Lorraine TGV</a> in France.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs the InterCity west to Namur/Brussels.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs some of the local services on the same line to Kleinbettingen/Arlon.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB and CFL jointly run the InterCity north to Liège/Liers.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</a>: regional branch of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail); runs a TER (regional) service between Luxembourg and Merz/Nancy to the south.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operator:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a> of SNCF (French Rail): Luxembourg to Paris Est about 6 times per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Montpellier once per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Marseille once per day. Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Two OUIGO stations easily accessible from Luxembourg are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV to the south.</p>
	      <h3 id="types-of-train-services">Types of train services</h3>
<p>Based on their stopping patters, there are various types of train services in Luxembourg. Luxembourg uses Luxembourgish equivalents of the German train-type nomenclature:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>RegionalBunn</em> (RB): all-stops service</li>
	<li><em>Regional-Express</em> (RE): skips some stations</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): usually only stops at larger stations</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The InterCity west from Luxembourg station to Namur/Brussels is run by NMBS/SNCB trains. On the same line, the RE/RB between Luxembourg and Kleinbettingen/Arlon is run by CFL trains or NMBS/SNCB trains. The InterCity north from Luxembourg station to Liège/Liers is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB (usually CFL locomotive with NMBS/SNCB carriages). East from Luxembourg station, CFL runs one RE per hour to Trier Hbf and Koblenz Hbf. In Germany this service is called the RE 11. Once per day, the CFL RE 11 continues further from Koblenz Hbf, and becomes an IC to Bonn Hbf, Köln Hbf (i.e. Cologne), and Düsseldorf Hbf. (CFL's RE 11 train is often coupled with DB Regio Südwest's RE 1 train between Koblenz Hbf and Trier Hbf: after arriving at Trier Hbf from Koblenz Hbf, they are decoupled, with RE 11 continuing to Luxembourg, and RE 1 continuing to Saarbrücken Hbf and Mannheim Hbf.)</p>
	  <p>For French trains in Luxembourg, French nomenclature is also used:</p>
	  <li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank"><em>Transport express régional</em></a> (TER): SNCF's brand of regional trains. They can be all-stops, or more like an RE. Some can travel very far. They make more stops than <em>Intercités</em>.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a>: SNCF's high-speed rail service.</li>

	  <h4>Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h4>
	  <p>The Luxembourgish public transport system is coordinated through the Luxembourgish <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>. The <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/" target="_blank">mobiliteit.lu</a> website gives information regarding all forms of public transport in Luxembourg. There is a mobiliteit.lu journey planner app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cdt" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mobiliteit-lu/id434829995?mt=8&ls=1" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="http://mobiliteitszentral.hafas.de/hafas/mz/detect.exe/d?processRedirect" target="_blank">symbian/BlackBerry</a>), and a separate mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. (But the mTicket app never worked on my phone; I use the CFL app instead.)</p>
  	  <p>For domestic and some cross-border traffic, Luxembourg has a unified time-based ticketing system for basically all forms of public transport. Other than domestic train travel in Luxembourg, the tickets also cover the buses and trams of the Luxembourgish bus/tram companies: <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus" target="_blank">AVL</a> (Luxembourg City bus), <a href="http://www.tice.lu/en" target="_blank">TICE</a> (Southwest/Esch-sur-Alzette area bus), RGTR (countrywide bus), and <a href="http://www.luxtram.lu/" target="_blank">Luxtram</a>.</p> 
<h5 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets</h5>
<p>The range of Luxembourgish tickets advertised on the websties/apps of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">CFL</a>, <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs" target="_blank">AVL</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank"><em>Verkéiersverbond</em></a> are slightly different, but they are the same Luxembourgish tickets. The most common Luxembourgish tickets are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Short time ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Kuerzzäitbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet courte durée</em>): €2 second class, €3 first class, valid for two hours from validation.</li>
	<li>Day ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Dagesbilljee</em>, French <em>Billet longue durée 1 jour</em>): €4 second class, €6 first class, valid till 04:00 the following day from validation.</li>
	<li>1 day group ticket (Luxembourgish <em>Gruppenbilljee 1 Dag</em>, French <em>Billet de groupe longue durée 1 jour</em>): €12 second class, ticket for 5 people, valid till 04:00 the following day from validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>carnets</em>: bundles of 10 short time tickets for the price of 8, or 5 day tickets for the price of 4. There are also 2 and 3 day versions of the 1 day tickets; their costs are just multiples of the 1 day tickets.</p>
<p>These Luxembourgish tickets give unlimited transfers amongst the modes of public transport where these tickets are valid (see <a href="#validity-area">below</a>). Passengers have to leave the train/bus/tram before the ticket expires, based on the timetable schedule of that train/bus/tram service. (Fine for not having a valid public transport ticket in Luxembourg is €150.)</p>
<p>Other than these 2-hour and day tickets, there are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-mensuels" target="_blank">monthly</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels" target="_blank">annual</a> subscriptions. With the monthly and annual subscriptions, there are 'entire network' options, and 'short distance' options. With the 'short distnace' options, you have to nominate an origin and a destination. In the clauses are a hexagon map (the monthly and annual subscription hexagon maps are slightly different); 'short distance' is maximally six hexagons away from a centre point. If the origin (the 0th hexagon) or the destination (the 6th hexagon) is coloured, then the entire field of coloured hexagons is considered one field / within the zone of validity.</p>
<p>There is a <em>Seniorekaart</em> for people aged 60 or above: €100 <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels/seniorekaart" target="_blank">second class</a>, or €200 <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels/seniorekaart1ereclasse" target="_blank">first class</a>. It is valid for one year of public transport.</p>
<p>For RégioZone 1 and RégioZone 2 beyond Luxembourg (see <a href="#validity-area">below</a>), there are a short time ticket, a day ticket, a monthly subscription, and an anuual subscription.</p>
<p>For Luxembourg City, the <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/citykaart" target="_blank">Citykaart</a> is a monthly subscription that is valid for all AVL buses, Luxtram, and some RGTR and CFL trains in Luxembourg City; see the validity map in that page.</p>
<p>There are yet other Luxembourgish subscriptions: see <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5 id="validity-area">Validity area of Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h5>
<p>For trains, the domestic tickets cover travels between any train station within Luxembourg (see the <a href="#maps">maps above</a>). For these stations right across the border:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France are only served by CFL, and are disconnected from the French passenger rail network (physically, and also not bookable through the SNCF website). These two stations are listed like other domestic stations in CFL's <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/gares-et-services/nos-gares" target="_blank">list of stations</a>, and they have Luxembourgish ticket machines. I suppose Luxembourgish domestic tickets are valid at these two stations, but you should ask.</li>
		<li>Athus in Belgium is considered the same tariff point as Rodange in Luxembourg (I asked CFL about this). In other words, Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus. However, there are no CFL ticket machines at Athus. At Athus, you can purchase a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or mTicket app, or from a CFL train conductor (€1 surcharge).</li>
</ul>
<p id="regiozone">For buses and trams, domestic Luxembourgish tickets are valid on AVL buses, TICE buses, RGTR buses, and Luxtram. Domestic Luxembourgish tickets are also valid on RGTR buses to/from some closest-by international localities. For further localities, there is a <em>RégioZone 1</em> and <em>RégioZone 2</em> tariff levels. (RégioZone 1 tariff includes RégioZone 1 and the domestic zone, RégioZone 2 tariff includes RégioZone 2, RégioZone 1, and the domestic zone.) See <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers/regiozone" target="_blank">this page</a> and the attachements (a list and a map) for localities in Belgium, France, and Germany where each of the three levels of tariff applies. (Domestic tariff is <em>Tarifs national</em>.)</p>
<p>Normal Luxembourgish tickets are valid on the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Express</a> bus to Saarbrücken Hbf; RégioZone 2 tariff applies.</p>
<p>Luxembourgish tickets are NOT valid on <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> (Wallonian Belgian) buses. (However, <a href="https://www.infotec.be/fr-be/acheteruntitre/titresettarifs/abonnements.aspx" target="_blank">TEC subscriptions</a> from TEC Namur-Luxembourg <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers" target="_blank">are valid</a> on AVL and RGTR buses.)</p>
<p>Some monthly and annual subscriptions have a restricted geogrpahical range; see <a href="#types-of-tickets">above</a>.</p> 
<h5>Channels of purchase and ticket media</h5>
<p>People with a Luxembourgish mobile phone number can <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/sms4ticket" target="_blank">send an SMS to 64222 with <em>A</em> as the content</a> for a 2-hour ticket. €2 for the ticket, and €0.25 for the SMS. Tickets are validated immediately. (You need to have a valid ticket as you board a train/bus/tram; sending this SMS only when you see a ticket inspector is way too late.)</p>
<p>The most-basic tickets can be purchased from a bus driver or a CFL train conductor. All tickets bought from a CFL train conductor has a €1 surcharge. Tickets are validated immediately.</p>
<p>There are the CFL app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), and the mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. (But the mTicket app never worked on my phone.) The CFL app takes Visa and Mastercard. The mTicket app takes DIGICASH (Luxembourgish bank transfer) and PayPal. With the CFL app, individual tickets, or the first ticket in a carnet, is validated immediately. The rest of the tickets in a carnet has to be validated in the app before usage. With the monthly network subscriptions, one can choose the starting date of the subscription.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/bornes-automatiques" target="_blank">CFL ticket machines</a> at all train stations in Luxembourg, at Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France, but apparently not in Athus in Belgium and other foreign stations served by CFL. The CFL ticket machines sell domestic tickets, and also some cross-border return tickets (see <a href="#cross-border">below</a>). You can switch between English, Luxembourgish, French, and German languages in the machines. The machines takes coins, and some cards (Vpay, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro). Very few machines take banknotes. Tickets are validated immediately after purchase. <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/fr/Documents/0General/Docs-Caches/How%20to%20operate%20the%20CFL%20ticket%20vending%20machines%20-%20Copy.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is a two-page pdf from CFL explaining in English how to use their ticket machines.</p>

	  <p>From some ticket counters (see <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart#faq" target="_blank"><em>Où est-ce que je peux obtenir ma mKaart ?</em></a>), an <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart" target="_blank"><em>mKaart</em></a> – Luxembourg's contactless RFID card – can be obtained for free when purchasing a Luxembourgish public transport ticket. The card has a validity of five years. There are anonymous cards, and personalised cards. Tickets and subscriptions can be loaded into an mKaart at the aforementioned ticket counters, at the ticket machines of the <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>, or from the mShop website (see next paragraph). This is the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/sites/default/files/layout-block/files/mkaart-guide-web.pdf" target="_blank">User Guide</a> (May 2017) of mKaart. To validate a ticket: a) if there is just one ticket/carnet in the card, just tap the card on the card reader, and that ticket is validated; b) if there are multiple tickets/carnets in the card, tap the card on the card reader, the screen then displays the tickets that the card has in it, you press the touchscreen for the ticket that you want to validate, and then you have to tap the card on the card reader again; c) if you want to validate multiple tickets, e.g., if the card is used by two people using two separate tickets in the card at the same time, repeat the procedures in b).</p>

	  <p>If you already have an mKaart, you can go to the <a href="https://mshop.lu/" target="_blank">mShop</a> website, set up an account / log into your account, and purchase Luxembourgish public transport tickets there. However: a) tickets ordered online are only available after 04:00 the next day; b) the tickets are not loaded automatically in an mKaart; <a href="https://mshop.lu/pages/pickup" target="_blank">you have to</a> go to a validator, press the circular red button on the top left corner of the touch screen, and then hold the card on the card reader until the tickets are loaded into the card.</p>

<p>The <em>Verkéiersverbond</em> has their ticket offices – the <em>Mobilitéitszentral</em> – at Luxembourg and Belval-Université stations. CFL has ticket offices at <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/vente-en-gare" target="_blank">ten stations</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cross-border">Special short-distance cross-border tickets</h4>
<p>For all of the following tickets/subscriptions, read the clauses very carefully, as international train travel involves unpredictable interactions between rules of different countries. None of the neighbouring countries have rules as generous as Luxembourg for, e.g., children, students, seniors, people with mobility issues, pets, bicycles. See also the <a href="#maps">maps</a> above.</p>
<h5>Belgium</h5>
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/belgique-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> between any station in Luxembourg and some near-by stations in Belgium. For the day-return tickets, the following options are available (TGL = all Luxembourgish stations):</p>
<ul>
	<li>TGL – Arlon/Messancy via Sterpenich frontier</li>
	<li>TGL – Messancy/Arlon via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Aubange/Halanzy/Virton via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
	<li>Troisvierges – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
</ul>
<p>CFL ticket machines only sell special day-return ticket tickets to Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts, and for 'Arlon via Sterpenich' and 'Arlon via Athus'. Tickets for Arlon via either route costs the same, but since railway companies are very particular about which frontier passengers cross for international travel, you should not mix these two routes and their corresponding tickets up. The other destinations in Arlon area cost the same as Arlon, except for Virton, and Messancy via Sterpenich, both of which are more expensive than the Arlon tickets. (Please ask whether you can use an 'Arlon via Athus' ticket for Halanzy/Aubange/Messancy via Athus.) For children: a) in Luxembourg, children 12 or younger travel for free; b) in Belgium, children 5 or younger travel for free; children 6 to 11 inclusive travel for free if accompanied by a passenger 12 or older with a valid ticket, and each such passenger can take along at most four children 6 to 11 years old for free; other children need to have child tickets.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> have destinations further in Belgium, and includes other public transport in Luxembourg. One commonality between these special-priced tickets/subscription is that <em>they cannot be combined with another Belgian domestic ticket on the same train</em>. For instance, do not board the IC from Luxembourg to Arlon on one of these special day return tickets, and then stay on the same train beyond Arlon with a Belgian domestic ticket. (On the other hand, if you have a full-fare Luxembourg &gt; Arlon ticket, there seems to be no such rule. But still, please ask first.)</p>
<p>The exact same range of tickets/subscriptions are also offered by NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail) in the reverse direction, with the same rules about not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train.</p>
<h5>France</h5>
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/luxembourg-lorraine-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> from any station in Luxembourg to Thionville/Metz/Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier on TER trains (not TGV trains). These tickets are also sold from CFL ticket machines. Child fare is applicable to children 4 to 11 years old inclusive. These special cross-border day return tickets are not sold in France.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there seems to be no special tickets to Longwy and beyond via the Rodange frontier. When buying an international ticket to Longwy, just get a domestic ticket, and then an international ticket between Rodange and Longwy. (That short international section between Rodange and Longwy is quite expensive. Getting an international ticket all the way from Luxembourg City to Longwy is horrendously expensive. If you have time, just catch a RGTR bus between Rodange and Longwy; the RGTR bus is covered by domestic Luxembourgish tickets.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/le-pass-luxembourg-hebdomadaire" target="_blank">weekly</a>, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexway" target="_blank">monthly</a>, and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexjunior" target="_blank">monthly for youth</a> subscriptions. These cover all train stations in Luxembourg and till a certain point on the TER line towards Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier, or to Longwy via the Rodange frontier. The monthly subscriptions also cover other forms of public transport in Luxembourg. For departure from Luxembourg, these subscriptions can be purchased by anyone in Luxembourg. In the other direction, they can only be purchased by residents of Lorraine (the French region south of Luxembourg).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Gare Lorraine Express</a> bus (to the station of Lorraine TGV) has tickets of its own, and this service must be pre-booked.</p>
<h5>Germany</h5>
<p>For train travel, there is a special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte" target="_blank">day return ticket</a> from any (predefined) station in Luxembourg to Trier, or from just Wasserbillig (on the border) to Trier. These tickets can be bought at ticket machines, and also from the CFL app. Child fare is applicable to children between 6 to 11 years old inclusive. Separate outbound and inbound tickets are issued, and they need to be presented together. (I don't know what <em>Les titres doivent être agrafés</em> 'the tickets need to be stapled' (?) in the clauses refers to.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/allemagne/oekocard-wittlich-luxemburg" target="_blank">monthly/annual subscriptions</a> along this line to as far as Wittlich.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Express</a> bus is covered by Luxembourgish RégioZone 2 tickets (see <a href="#regiozone">above</a>).</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/titres-de-transport-pour-voyageurs-en-groupe" target="_blank">this</a> for group tickets (six or more people).</p>
<p>For one to five people, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/rheinland-pfalz-ticket-plus-lu" target="_blank">Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket Lux</a>, which costs €30/36/42/48/54 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for a day, covering: a) in Luxembourg, the CFL domestic railway network; b) railway across the Igel frontier; c) in the German states of <em>Rheinland-Pfalz</em> (Rhineland-Palatinate) and <em>Saarland</em> (plus some bordering regions), local trains (IRE/RE/RB/S-bahn) and bus/trams. (See the validity area and other rules in the clauses. Read them very carefully.) The names of the holders have to be written on the ticket. This ticket can be purchased from the CFL ticket machines.</p>
<p>From Germany, <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/en/" target="_blank">VRT</a> (Trier transport authority) has the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tagesticket-delux" target="_blank">day ticket</a> <em>TagesTicket DeLux</em>, and the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-monat" target="_blank">month</a> / <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-jahr" target="_blank">year</a> subscription <em>MobilTicket DeLux Monat/Jahr</em>. There are five tariff levels: from <em>Übergangstarifzone 1</em> closest to Luxembourg, to <em>Übergangstarifzone 5</em> covering the entire VRT area. These tickets/subscriptions cover the non-high-speed trains and buses in Luxembourg and the VRT area, but border crossing is restricted to: a) railway across the Igel frontier, or b) bus <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=401" target="_blank">401</a> and <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=407" target="_blank">407</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tickets-luxemburg" target="_blank">VRT to Luxembourg page</a> for further illustrations.</p>
<h5>France and Germany</h5>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering the local trains in Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (See the validity area and other rules in the clauses; read them very carefully.)</p>
<h4 id="international-ticketing">International ticketing</h4>
<p>International tickets can be purchased at <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/vente-en-gare" target="_blank">CFL ticket offices</a>. Luxembourg station has a separate international ticket office. Very near the international office (indoor) is an SNCF long-distance-train ticket machine for France.</p>
<p>One can also book international train tickets from the CFL website. For international e-tickets to/from Luxembourg, (I think) you always have to print the ticket out on a piece of A4 paper. There is the Luxembourgish version of the <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl?ectrans=1" target="_blank">SNCF website</a> for destinations in France, and the Luxembourgish version of the <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a> for destinations in other countries. With the SNCF website, the Luxembourgish version and the French version seem to give the same prices. With the NMBS/SNCB booking webpage, however, it is worth checking the prices given by the CFL vs. NMBS/SNCB versions. The following are the international booking webpages of some nearby countries:</p>
<ul>
	<li>France: <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a></li>
	<li>Belgium: <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB International</a></li>
	<li>The Netherlands: <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en" target="_blank">NS International</a></li>
	<li>Germany: <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">DB</a></li>
	<li>Switzerland: <a href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html" target="_blank">SBB/CFF/FFS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Belgium, other than full-flex tickets, there are also the mid-flex tickets of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/weekend" target="_blank">weekend return</a> (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/youth1" target="_blank">youth single/return</a> (for people 25 years or younger). These give 30&amp; off full fare. Otherwise, there are also the no-flex return tickets within 30 days called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/escapade" target="_blank">Escapade 1/2/3</a> (€52/74/96 second class, or €86/135/180 first class, for 1/2/3 people), and the youth version <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/pass-partout-26-ans" target="_blank">Pass Partout</a> (€22 second class per person), between any pre-defined station in Luxembourg and any pre-defined station in Belgium. With these normal international tickets, unlike the special cross-border return tickets (see <a href="#cross-border">above</a>), I don't see a clause which says that these tickets cannot be used in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (but do ask).</p>
<p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="belgium.html#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone. See also the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page for train travel in or through Belgium.</p>
<p>For Germany, there is a saver fare (i.e. non-flexible fare) called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/sparpreis" target="_blank"><em>Sparpreis Europa</em></a> for international tickets which involve at least one section of travel on long-distance trains (e.g. ICE/IC/EC) in Germany. I think tickets on this price to/from any train station in Luxembourg cost the same for the same train service across the Igel frontier. (To be sure, check the price to/from Wasserbillig vs. price to/from other stations in Luxembourg.)</p>
<p>For the Netherlands, usually going through Belgium is faster and cheaper. However, it is also worth checing options involving going through Germany instead, especially if you have to book a trip departing within six days, or going to places in the Netherlands close to the German border.</p>
	  <p>For France, TGV and OUIGO has dynamic pricing (i.e. book early for the best price), while TER has fixed price.</p>
<p>Also read the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> and <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> pages for rules regarding children, seniors, pets, and bicycles in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. (Basically none of them has rules as generous as Luxembourg.)</p>
