<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on travelling by train in/to/from/through Luxembourg. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips on Luxembourg in that page are repeated here.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is <em>Lëtzebuerg</em> in Luxembourgish, <em>Luxembourg</em> in French, and <em>Luxemburg</em> in German and Dutch. This is Luxembourg's <a href="http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/" target="_blank">official website</a>, and <a href="https://www.visitluxembourg.com/en" target="_blank">tourism website</a>. Luxembourg is the only Grand Duchy (<em>Groussherzogtum</em> / <em>Grand-Duché</em> / <em>Großherzogtum</em>) remaining in the world, and Luxembourg is often referred simply as the Grand Duchy. Other than the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there is also the <a href="http://www.province.luxembourg.be/" target="_blank">Province of Luxembourg</a> in neighbouring Belgium, which was historically a part of the Grand Duchy. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg also lost territories</a> to Prussia and France.) The primary train station in the Grand Duchy is Luxembourg Station, in <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/" target="_blank">Luxembourg City</a>, the capital.</p>

<p>A number of companies run passenger rail services in Luxembourg. The following map shows the coverage of the various railway companies in Luxembourg (plus the Netherlands and Belgium; Luxembourg is LU in the map).</p>

<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CFL (<em>Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois</em> 'National Company of the Luxembourgish Railways'; <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215" target="_blank">iOS</a>. <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">International booking webpage</a>): the Luxembourgish national railway company. Its network extends a little bit into Belgium and France, and a long way into Germany along a single line to Trier Hbf / Wittlich Hbf / Koblenz Hbf, and once a day further to Düsseldorf Hbf.</a>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Also runs coach services to <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/ticket/internationaldetail/saarbrueckenexpress" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Hbf</a> in Germany and <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/ticket/internationaldetail/gare-lorraine" target="_blank">Lorraine TGV</a> in France.</li>
	      </ul></li>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (domestic <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064" target="_blank">iOS</a>; international <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Belgian national railway company, runs all the way into Luxembourg station from the west and the north:
	<ul>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs the InterCity west to Namur and Brussels.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB or CFL runs the local services on the same line to Kleinbettingen or Arlon.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB and CFL jointly run the InterCity north to Liège and Liers.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</a>: regional branch of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail); runs a TER (regional) service between Luxembourg and Merz/Nancy to the south.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operator:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a> of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail): Luxembourg – Paris Est about 6 times per day, to Strasbourg / Lyon / Montpellier once per day, to Strasbourg / Lyon / Marseille once per day. Follows French long-distance ticketing rules.</li>
	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Two OUIGO stations easily accessible from Luxembourg are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV to the south.</p>

	<p>Based on their stopping patterns, there are various types of train services in Luxembourg. Luxembourg uses Luxembourgish equivalents of the German nomenclature:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>RegionalBunn</em> (RB): all-stops service</li>
	<li><em>Regional-Express</em> (RE): skips some stations</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): usually only stops at larger stations</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The InterCity going west from Luxembourg to Namur/Brussels is run by NMBS/SNCB. On the same line, the RE or RB between Luxembourg and Kleinbettingen/Arlon is run by CFL or NMBS/SNCB trains. The InterCity going north from Luxembourg to Liège/Liers is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB (CFL locomotives with NMBS/SNCB carriages). Going east from Luxembourg, CFL runs one RB (called RB 83 in Germany) per hour Monday to Saturday to Trier Hbf and Wittlich Hbf, and also one RE (called RE 11) per hour everyday to Trier Hbf, Wittlich Hbf, and Koblenz Hbf. Once per day, the CFL RE 11 continues further from Koblenz Hbf, and becomes an IC to Bonn Hbf, Köln Hbf (i.e. Cologne), and Düsseldorf Hbf. (CFL's RE 11 train is often coupled with DB Regio Südwest's RE 1 train between Koblenz Hbf and Trier Hbf; RE 11 goes to to Luxembourg, and RE 1 goes to Saarbrücken Hbf and Mannheim Hbf.)</p>
	  <p>For French trains in Luxembourg, French nomenclature is also used:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank"><em>Transport express régional</em></a> (TER): SNCF's brand of regional trains. They can be all-stops, or more like RE. Some can travel very far, like shorter versions of Intercités. Unlike Intercités, which is funded by the national government, TER is funded by regional governments.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a>: SNCF's high-speed rail service.</li>

	  <p>'P' is a Belgian nomenclature for supplementary services (usually additional services during peak-hours). The P trains that cross the Belgian–Luxembourgish border are classified as RB, RE, or IC in Luxembourg, based on their stopping patterns in Luxembourg.

	  <p>You may be interested in the CFL printed timetables for <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/timetable#nationalTimetable" target="_blank">domestic/cross-border destinations</a>, and <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/timetable#internationalTimetable" target="_blank">international destinations</a>. (The information in the printed timetables is not necessarily up to date; always check with CFL for the latest information.)</p>
	  <p>These are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1drY-p_Chjqxzyl-J7z-_njQAEFODvJIpzceTmVbBQgY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">timetable spreadsheets for the high-speed rail services in/to/from/through Benelux</a> that I have compiled. (I cannot guarentee their accuracy! Click on the tabs for the various sheets. Timetabling for high-speed rail services is often very irregular, and they often change every few months; always check their websites for the latest information.)</p>
	  <h3 id="ticketing-matters">Ticketing matters</h3>
	  <p>The Luxembourgish public transport system is coordinated through the Luxembourgish <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>. The <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/" target="_blank">mobiliteit.lu</a> website gives information regarding all forms of public transport in Luxembourg. There is a mobiliteit.lu journey planner app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cdt" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/lu/app/mobiliteit-lu/id434829995?ls=1" target="_blank">iOS</a>).</p>
	  <h4 id="free-of-charge">Free of charge</h4>
	  <p>Second class travel on trains is free within Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish railway network extends into Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France; there are Luxembourgish ticket machines at these stations, and these two stations are not connected to the French railway network. Athus in Belgium is considered the same tariff point as Rodange in Luxembourg (<a href="images/CFL_Screen_Shot_2018-06-16.png" target="_blank">I asked CFL about this</a>). In other words, Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus (i.e. free on second class). However, there are no CFL ticket machines at Athus.</p>
	  <p><a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/customerservices/detail/services-a-bord-du-train#tab-2" target="_blank">Bicycles</a>, <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/customerservices/detail/services-a-bord-du-train#tab-3" target="_blank">pets</a>, and <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/customerservices/detail/services-a-bord-du-train#tab-4" target="_blank">luggage</a> also travel for free on CFL trains domestically.</p>

<figcaption>CFL trains have hooks inside carriages for hanging bicycles vertically</figcaption></figure> 
	  <p>Travel is also free with <a href="http://www.luxtram.lu/" target="_blank">Luxtram</a>, and domestic travel in Luxembourg with the bus companies: <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/en/getting-around/bus" target="_blank">AVL</a> (Luxembourg City bus), <a href="http://www.tice.lu/en" target="_blank">TICE</a> (Southwest/Esch-sur-Alzette area bus), RGTR (countrywide bus). Germans bus 410 (Luxembourg – Bitburg) is also covered under Luxembourgish tariff.</p>
	  <p>Before the change on 1 March 2020, a two-hour ticket is €2, and a day ticket is €4 for domestic travel with Luxembourgish public transport operators. Transfers are unlimited.</p>
	  <h4 id="not-free-of-charge">Not free of charge</h4>
	  <p>First class travel on trains within Luxembourg remains unchanged: €3 two-hour ticket, €6 day ticket, €37.5 short-distance month ticket, €75 month ticket, €330 short-distance year ticket, €660 year ticket.</p>
	  <p>Passengers have to leave the train/bus/tram that they are on before the ticket expires, based on the timetable schedule of that train/bus/tram service. Two-hour tickets expire after two hours from the time of ticket validation, and day tickets expire at 04:00 the following day. (Fine for not having a valid public transport ticket in Luxembourg is €150.)</p>
	  <p>For short-distance month and year tickets, look at <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wabennetz.pdf" target="_blank">this hexagonal map</a>, you nominate a starting point first, and 'short-distance' is six hexagons from the starting hexagon, with the starting hexagone being the zeroth hexagon. If the zeroth or the sixth hexagon is a purple hexagon, then the entire patch of purple hexagon is considered one hexagon.</p>
	  <p>There are special train deals with nearby areas in neighbouring countries; see the sections on <a href="#special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-germany">Germany</a>, <a href="#special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-belgium">Belgium</a>, and <a href="#special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-france">France</a>.</p>
	  <p>For RGTR buses that cross the border, and German bus 410: free within Luxembourg, otherwise €3 one way, €5 day ticket, €40 month ticket, €360 year ticket ('RegioZone 1 fare')</p>
	  <p>The exception is the last two stops of bus 155 (Dillingen and Saarlouis in Saarland): €5 one way, €9 day ticket, €85 month ticket, €750 year ticket ('Regio Zone 2 fare'). CFL's <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/ticket/internationaldetail/saarbrueckenexpress" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Express</a> bus also has this Regio Zone 2 tariff.</p>
	  <p>Before the change on 1 March 2020, RegioZone 1: €5 2-hours, €9 day ticket, €85 month ticket, €750 year ticket; RegioZone 2: €9 2-hours, €16 day ticket, €135 month ticket, €1190 year ticket.
	  <p>The Wallonian public transport operator <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> runs a few of its own services to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, but it does not participate in Luxembourgish ticketing. <a href="https://www.infotec.be/fr-be/acheteruntitre/titresettarifs/abonnements.aspx" target="_blank">TEC subscriptions</a> from TEC Namur-Luxembourg <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/fr/billet/tec/" target="_blank">are not valid</a> on the cross-border RGTR buses.</p>
<h4 id="channels-of-purchase-and-ticket-media">Channels of purchase and ticket media</h4>
<p>The basic tickets can be purchased from a bus driver or a CFL train conductor (train attendent). All tickets bought from a CFL train conductor have a €1 surcharge. Tickets are validated immediately.</p>
<p>There are the CFL app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215" target="_blank">iOS</a>), and the mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. The CFL app takes Visa and Mastercard. The mTicket app takes DIGICASH (Luxembourgish bank transfer) and PayPal. A ticket is validated immediately. When ordering a monthly network subscription in the app, one can choose the starting date of the subscription.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/saleschannels/detail/distributeurs-automatiques" target="_blank">CFL ticket machines</a> at all train stations in Luxembourg, at Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France, but apparently not in Athus in Belgium and other foreign stations served by CFL. The CFL ticket machines sell domestic tickets, and also some cross-border tickets. <a href="https://www.cfl.lu/Cfl.Voyageur/media/Distributeurs-automatiques/How-to-operate-the-CFL-ticket-vending-machines.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is a two-page explanation in English from CFL on how to use the CFL ticket machines, including a list of cross-border tickets available from the ticket machines. In the machine, you can switch between Luxembourgish, French, German, and English languages. The machines take coins, and some cards (Vpay, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro). Very few machines take banknotes. Tickets are validated immediately after purchase.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart" target="_blank"><em>mKaart</em></a> is Luxembourg's contactless RFID card. After second class public transport becomes free on 1 March 2020, the mKaart remains in use for first -class train tickets, cross-border bus tickets, and accessing mBox (bike storage at train stations). An mKaart can be obtained for free when purchasing a Luxembourgish public transport ticket at some ticket counters. The card has a validity of five years. There are anonymous cards, and personalised cards.

	  <p>For train travel, there is a special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte" target="_blank">day return ticket</a> from any pre-nominated station in Luxembourg to Trier, or just from Wasserbillig (on the border) to Trier at a cheaper price. These tickets can be bought from a ticket machines, or from the CFL app. Child fare is applicable to children between 6 to 11 years old inclusive. Separate outbound and inbound tickets are issued, and they need to be presented together. (I do not understand what the line <em>Les titres doivent être agrafés</em> 'the tickets need to be stapled' (?) in the terms and conditions means; they need to be time-stamped at a validator machine? they need to be physically stapled together?) This day return ticket is also available in the opposite direction from Trier to Luxembourg.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/allemagne/oekocard-wittlich-luxemburg" target="_blank">monthly/annual subscriptions</a> along this line to as far as Wittlich.</p>

<p>For one to five people, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/rheinland-pfalz-ticket-plus-lu" target="_blank">Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket &#43; Lux</a>, which costs €30/37/44/51/58 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for a day (slightly cheaper booking online from <a href="https://fahrkarten.bahn.de/privatkunde/pauschalpreisbuchen/pauschalpreis_start.post?angebotsgruppe=113&returnurl=https://www.bahn.de/index.shtml&scope=standalone&dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN0001_Regio_TZ1_P1_BT_S_AL_RT_RHLPFALZ_TICKET_LUX_LZ08#stay" target="_blank">DB</a>), covering: a) in Luxembourg, the CFL domestic railway network; b) railway across the Igel frontier; c) in the German states of <em>Rheinland-Pfalz</em> (Rhineland-Palatinate) and <em>Saarland</em> (plus some bordering regions), local trains (IRE/RE/RB/S-bahn) and bus/trams. It is valid on Mon–Fri from 09:00 in Germany (i.e. valid on a train departing Luxembourg station at about 08:30), and no restrictions on Sat–Sun. (See the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions. Read them very carefully.) The names of the holders have to be written on the ticket. This ticket can be purchased from the CFL ticket machines. (Within Germany, there is also the <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/regio/regionale-tickets/rhldpfalz/rheinland-pfalz-ticket.shtml" target="_blank">Rheinland-Pflaz-Ticket</a>, which is Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket &#43; Lux minus Luxembourg. <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/regio/regionale-tickets/saar/saarland-ticket.shtml?dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN_-ta-NAVIGATION-regionale-angebote-regionale-tickets-saarland_LZ01" target="_blank">Saarland-Ticket</a> is the same thing as Rheinland-Pflaz-Ticket.)</p>
	  <p>If you are buying a ticket from Luxembourg to Koblenz Hbf (or slightly before Koblenz Hbf), one-way: the line between Luxembourg and Koblenz Hbf is an RE service, i.e. German local train fare rules apply. The CFL and NMBS/SNCB International websites offer you the full fare of approximately €45 one-way (in early 2019). The DB website, however, automatically also offers you the <em>Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket &#43; Lux</em>, e.g. €30 for a 1-person ticket (see immediately above), if the journey is not before 09:00 on weekdays. Other than the fact that it cannot be refunded/altered, the <em>Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket &#43; Lux</em> is a considerably better deal, giving you basically unlimited day travel. If you are going only one-way (not returning on the same day), and departing very early (about 06:00), consider buying a ticket from DB on the direct Luxembourg – Koblenz – Düsseldorf service to Andernach, which is one station past Koblenz Hbf. Because the section between Koblenz and Düsseldorf is classed as an IC service, German long-distance train fare rules apply when the ticket includes a section on a long-distance service in Germany (IC in this case). A Luxembourg – Andernach one-way ticket from DB can be as cheap as €20 (<em>Super Sparpreis</em>; no flex). There is no rule which says that you cannot leave the train at Koblenz Hbf. (But the IC section between Koblenz Hbf and Andernach on the ticket is then forfeited, on a <em>Super/Sparpreis</em> ticket.) The direct train from Düsseldorf goes back to Luxembourg in the afternoon; with such an Andernach – Luxembourg one-way ticket, you can join the Koblenz – Luxembourg RE service as stated on the ticket, or the RE services thereafter.</p>
	  <p>From Germany, <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/en/" target="_blank">VRT</a> (Trier transport authority) has the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tagesticket-delux" target="_blank">day ticket</a> <em>TagesTicket DeLux</em>, and the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-monat" target="_blank">month</a> / <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-jahr" target="_blank">year</a> subscriptions <em>MobilTicket DeLux Monat/Jahr</em>. There are five tariff levels: from <em>Übergangstarifzone 1</em> closest to Luxembourg, to <em>Übergangstarifzone 5</em> covering the entire VRT area. These tickets/subscriptions cover the non-high-speed trains and buses in Luxembourg and the VRT area, but border crossing is restricted to railway across the Igel frontier, <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=401" target="_blank">bus 401</a>, and <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=407" target="_blank">bus 407</a>. This ticket is not valid on Luxembourgish cross-border buses 100, 116, 117, 118, 134, and 157. See also the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tickets-luxemburg" target="_blank">VRT to Luxembourg page</a> for further illustrations.</p>
	  <p>South of the VRT region, sharing a short border with Luxembourg is the <a href="https://saarvv.de/" target="_blank">saarVV</a> region of Saarland. saarVV tariff extends a little bit into France, but apparently not into Luxembourg. In the opposite direction, Luxembourgish buses extend into Saarland.</p> 
	  <p>The Moselle/Mosel/Musel forms the border between Luxembourg and Germany from Schengen down to Wasserbillig, and is very scenic. Running along the Mosel on the German side is RB 82 Perl – Trier Hbf – Wittlich Hbf. The following are some railway stations right across from Luxembourg: In Saarland, Perl is right across from Schengen, and Nennig is across from Remich. In Rhineland-Palatinate, Wincheringen is across from Wormeldange, Wellen (Mosel) is across from Grevenmacher, and Oberbillig is across from Wasserbillig. South of Perl, passenger trains on this line cross the Apach frontier to Thionville and Metz in France only twice in each direction on Saturday and Sunday (RE 16). SNCF TER runs buses between Thionville and Apach/Perl on Monday to Saturday.</p>
	  <p>For the Luxembourg – Germany – France tripoint region, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering most of the local trains in Saarland (Germany), Lorraine (France), and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (Check the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions; read them very carefully.)</p>
 	      <p>See the <a href="index.html#germany">Germany section in the home page</a> for the local transport tickets that cover the whole Germany.</p>
  	  <h4 id="other-international-tickets-germany">Other international tickets</h4>	  
<p>For Germany, there is a saver fare (i.e. non-flexible fare) called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/sparpreis1" target="_blank"><em>Sparpreis Europa</em></a> for international tickets which involve at least one section of travel on long-distance trains (e.g. ICE/IC/EC) in Germany. Before or after the German ICE/IC/EC journey, <em>Sparpries</em> gives a free connecting journey on slower trains (including IC and local trains in Benelux) up to a certain distance. After that, the price increases in increments of €10.</p>
	  <p>With Luxembourg, the free connecting distance is hard to predict: for some journeys, <em>Sparpreis</em> to the entire country costs the same; in other instances, <em>Sparpreis</em> to/from Wasserbillig on the border is €10 cheaper than to/from Luxembourg station. It is best to compare <em>Sparpries</em> to/from Trier Hbf, Wasserbillig, and other destinations in Luxembourg.</p>

	  <h4 id="special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-belgium">Special short-distance cross-border tickets</h4>	  
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/belgique-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> between any station in Luxembourg and some near-by stations in Belgium. For the day-return tickets, the following options are available (TGL = any Luxembourgish station; see also the <a href="#maps">maps</a> above):</p>
<ul>
	<li>TGL – Arlon/Messancy via Sterpenich frontier</li>
	<li>TGL – Messancy/Arlon via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Aubange/Halanzy/Virton via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
	<li>Troisvierges – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
</ul>
	  <p>(Troisvierges is the northern-most station in Luxembourg, just before the Gouvy frontier.)</p>
<p>CFL ticket machines only sell special day-return ticket tickets to Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts, and for 'Arlon via Sterpenich' and 'Arlon via Athus'. Tickets for Arlon via either route costs the same, but since railway companies are very particular about which frontier a passenger cross for international travel, you better not mix these two routes and their corresponding tickets up. The other destinations to the west of Luxembourg cost the same as Arlon, except for Messancy via Sterpenich, and Virton, both of which are more expensive than the Arlon tickets. (Although costing the same, I assume you cannot use an 'Arlon via Athus' ticket for Halanzy/Aubange/Messancy via Athus? Please ask.)</p> 
	  <p>For children: a) in Luxembourg, children 12 or younger travel for free; b) in Belgium, children 5 or younger travel for free, children 6 to 11 inclusive travel for free if accompanied by a passenger 12 or older with a valid ticket, and each such passenger can take along at most four children 6 to 11 years old for free; otherwise a child needs to have a child ticket.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> have destinations further in Belgium, and includes other public transport in Luxembourg. One commonality between these special-priced tickets/subscription is that <em>they CANNOT be combined with another Belgian domestic ticket on the same train</em>. For instance, do not board the IC from Luxembourg to Arlon with one of these special day return tickets, and then stay on the same train beyond Arlon with a Belgian domestic ticket.</p>
<p>The exact same range of tickets/subscriptions are also offered by NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail) in the opposite direction, with the same rules about not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train.</p>
	  <h4 id="other-international-tickets-belgium">Other international tickets</h4>	  
	  <p>For Belgium, other than full-flex tickets, there are also the mid-flex tickets of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/weekend" target="_blank">weekend return</a> (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/youth1" target="_blank">youth single/return</a> (for people 25 years or younger). These give 30&#37; off full fare.</p> 
	<p>Otherwise, there are also the no-flex 30-day return tickets called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/escapade" target="_blank">Escapade 1/2/3</a> (€55/77/99 second class, or €90/140/190 first class, for 1/2/3 people), and the youth version called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/pass-partout-26-ans" target="_blank">Pass Partout</a> (€22 second class per person return), between any pre-nominated station in Luxembourg and any pre-nominated station in Belgium. (Pass Partout seems to be only available from Luxembourg.) With these normal international tickets, unlike the special cross-border return tickets, you can use them in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (<a href="images/B_International_Screen_Shot_2018-06-12.png" target="_blank">I asked NMBS/SNCB International about this</a>).</p>
<p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="belgium.html#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone.</p>
<h3 id="netherlands">Train deals with the Netherlands</h3>
	  <p>Also read further in the <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> page.
	  <p>For the Netherlands, going via Belgium, firstly there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/pays-bas/early-bird-week-early-bird-weekend" target="_blank">Early Bird</a> deal: fixed discount when booked seven or more days ahead of the departure date, on non-high-speed trains. The discount is on average 40&#37; for Monday to Thursday departures, and 20&#37; for Friday to Sunday departures. There are equivalent deals from Belgium to the Netherlands, and from the Netherlands to Belgium, or to Luxembourg via Belgium. In the Netherlands, with an international ticket, the <a href="netherlands.html#surcharges">ICd surcharge</a> is not applicable. Something that I have only seen mentioned in the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/fr/Documents/Billets-Abonnements/EARLY_BIRD_18_04_09_inet.pdf" target="_blank">CFL terms and condition for the Early Bird deal</a> is that the <a href="netherlands.html#surcharges">ICE surcharge in the Netherlands </a> is also not applicable. (But the ICE surcharge in Belgium is applicable.) If booking this deal from the Netherlands, it is best to do so online; the Dutch ticket machines and the normal ticket counters only sell full fare tickets, while the NS International ticket counters and telephone booking usually charge hefty booking fees.</p>    
<p>Another deal, only available from CFL, is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/pays-bas/nederland-speciaal" target="_blank"><em>Nederland Speciaal</em></a>: 40&#37; discount for a 30-day return ticket, between any station in Luxembourg and any station in the Netherlands. With this deal, the transit route between Luxembourg and the Netherlands has to be (Troisvierges) –[Gouvy frontier]– Liège –[Visé frontier]– (Maastricht).</p>
<p>For the Netherlands, usually going through Belgium is faster and cheaper. However, it is also worth checing options going through Germany instead, especially if the discounts via Belgium are not available to you, and/or if you are going to places in the Netherlands close to the German border. Even for Amsterdam, if you book late, it is worth comparing prices going through Belgium versus Germany.</p>
<h3 id="france">Train deals with France</h3>
	  <h4 id="special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-france">Special short-distance cross-border tickets</h4>	  
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/luxembourg-lorraine-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> from any station in Luxembourg to Thionville/Metz/Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier on TER trains (not TGV trains). These tickets are also sold from CFL ticket machines. Child fare is applicable to children 4 to 11 years old inclusive. There seems to be an equivalent ticket sold in <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est/offres/forfaits/lorraine/lorraine_ticket-lorraine-luxembourg" target="_blank">France</a> in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there seems to be no special day tickets to Longwy and beyond via the Rodange frontier. When buying an international ticket to Longwy, just get a domestic Luxembourgish ticket, and an international ticket between Rodange and Longwy or further. That short international section between Rodange and Longwy is quite expensive. Getting an international ticket all the way from Luxembourg City to Longwy is horrendously expensive, based on what SNCF charges on the internet. (If you have time, just catch a RGTR bus between Rodange and Longwy; the RGTR bus to Longwy is covered by domestic Luxembourgish tickets.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/le-pass-luxembourg-hebdomadaire" target="_blank">weekly</a>, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexway" target="_blank">monthly</a>, and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexjunior" target="_blank">youth monthly</a> subscriptions. These cover all train stations in Luxembourg and till some point on the TER line towards Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier, or to Longwy via the Rodange frontier. The monthly subscriptions also cover other forms of public transport in Luxembourg. For departures from Luxembourg, these subscriptions can be purchased by anyone in Luxembourg. In the other direction, they can only be purchased by residents of Lorraine (the French region south of Luxembourg).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Gare Lorraine Express</a> bus (to the station of Lorraine TGV) has tickets of its own, and this service must be pre-booked.</p>
	<p>For the Luxembourg – Germany – France tripoint region, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering nearly all the local trains in Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (See the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions; read them very carefully.)</p>

<p>For France, TGV and OUIGO has dynamic pricing (i.e. book early for the best price), while TER has fixed price. SNCF charges a horrendous amount for connecting train trips within Luxembourg. For TGV, book till Luxembourg; for TER, book till Bettembourg (if you do not have a special Lorraine–Luxembourg day return ticket). Get domestic Luxembourgish tickets from Luxembourg/Bettembourg if you have to travel further in Luxembourg.</p>
	  <h3 id="england">England</h3>
	  <p>There are no special deals between Eurostar and Luxembourg. The most direct connections from Luxembourg to Eurostar are: a) TGV Luxembourg to Paris Est &gt; walk or metro one stop to Paris Nord &gt; Eurostar; b) InterCity Luxembourg to Brussels-Midi/Zuid &gt; Eurostar. The cheapest way would be catching a CFL train to Athus (domestic Luxembourgish ticket), and then use an <a href="belgium.html#UKABS">Any Belgian Station</a> + Eurostar ticket from Athus (but Belgian trains only go to Athus on weekdays/non-Belgian holidays). You can also get a NORMAL FULL-FARE Luxembourg &gt; Arlon international ticket, and then use an Any Belgian Station + Eurostar ticket from Arlon on the Luxembourg &gt; Brussels IC (you can do this; <a href="images/B_International_Screen_Shot_2018-06-12.png" target="_blank">I asked NMBS/SNCB International about this</a>; just make sure that you are not using a special day-return ticket between Luxembourg and Arlon, as these special day tickets cannot be combined with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train).</p>
