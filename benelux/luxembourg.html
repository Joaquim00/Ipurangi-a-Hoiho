<p>Greetings! Here are some tips on travelling by train in/to/from/through Luxembourg. See also the <a href="index.html">home</a> page for tips on train travel in Benelux in general; not all tips on Luxembourg in that page are repeated here.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is <em>Lëtzebuerg</em> in Luxembourgish, <em>Luxembourg</em> in French, and <em>Luxemburg</em> in German and Dutch. This is Luxembourg's <a href="http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/" target="_blank">official website</a>, and <a href="https://www.visitluxembourg.com/en" target="_blank">tourism website</a>. Luxembourg is the only Grand Duchy (<em>Groussherzogtum</em> / <em>Grand-Duché</em> / <em>Großherzogtum</em>) remaining in the world, and Luxembourg is often referred simply as the Grand Duchy. Other than the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there is also the <a href="http://www.province.luxembourg.be/" target="_blank">Province of Luxembourg</a> in neighbouring Belgium, which was historically a part of the Grand Duchy. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg also lost territories</a> to Prussia and France.) The primary train station in the Grand Duchy is Luxembourg Station, in <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/" target="_blank">Luxembourg City</a>, the capital.</p>

<br/>
	<p>Operators of non-high-speed trains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CFL (<em>Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois</em> 'National Company of the Luxembourgish Railways'; <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/en/home" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>.

Its network extends a little bit into Belgium and France, and a long way into Germany with a single line: RE to Trier Hbf / Koblenz Hbf, and once a day further as IC to Düsseldorf Hbf.</a>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Also runs coach services to <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/luxembourg-saarbr%C3%BCcken" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Hbf</a> in Germany and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Lorraine TGV</a> in France.</li>
	      </ul></li>
	<li>NMBS/SNCB (domestic <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-nmbs/id403212064?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>; international <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmbs" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/sncb-international/id577730301?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>): the Belgian national railway company, runs all the way into Luxembourg station from the west and the north:
	<ul>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs the InterCity west to Namur and Brussels.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB runs some of the local services on the same line to Kleinbettingen or Arlon.</li>
		<li>NMBS/SNCB and CFL jointly run the InterCity north to Liège and Liers.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</a>: regional branch of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail); runs a TER (regional) service between Luxembourg and Merz/Nancy to the south.</li>
	</ul>		
<p>High-speed rail service operator:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl" target="_blank">TGV</a> of <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/" target="_blank">SNCF</a> (French Rail): Luxembourg – Paris Est about 6 times per day, to Strasbourg/Lyon/Montpellier twice per day, from Montpellier/Lyon/Strasbourg once per day, and from Marseille/Lyon/Strasbourg once per day.

	</ul>
	      <p><a href="https://www.ouigo.com/" target="_blank">OUIGO</a> is SNCF's low-cost domestic high-speed service in France. Two OUIGO stations easily accessible from Luxembourg are Metz-Ville and Lorraine TGV to the south.</p>

	<p>Based on their stopping patterns, there are various types of train services in Luxembourg. Luxembourg uses Luxembourgish equivalents of the German nomenclature:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>RegionalBunn</em> (RB): all-stops service</li>
	<li><em>Regional-Express</em> (RE): skips some stations</li>
	<li><em>InterCity</em> (IC): usually only stops at larger stations</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The InterCity going west from Luxembourg to Namur/Brussels is run by NMBS/SNCB. On the same line, the RE or RB between Luxembourg and Kleinbettingen/Arlon is run by CFL or NMBS/SNCB trains. The InterCity going north from Luxembourg to Liège/Liers is run jointly by CFL and NMBS/SNCB (usually CFL locomotive with NMBS/SNCB carriages). Going east from Luxembourg, CFL runs at least one RE per hour to Trier Hbf and Koblenz Hbf. In Germany this service is called the RE 11. Once per day, the CFL RE 11 continues further from Koblenz Hbf, and becomes an IC to Bonn Hbf, Köln Hbf (i.e. Cologne), and Düsseldorf Hbf. (CFL's RE 11 train is often coupled with DB Regio Südwest's RE 1 train between Koblenz Hbf and Trier Hbf: after arriving at Trier Hbf from Koblenz Hbf, they are decoupled, with RE 11 continuing to Luxembourg, and RE 1 continuing to Saarbrücken Hbf and Mannheim Hbf.)</p>
	  <p>For French trains in Luxembourg, French nomenclature is also used:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank"><em>Transport express régional</em></a> (TER): SNCF's brand of regional trains. They can be all-stops, or more like RE. Some can travel very far, like shorter versions of Intercités. Unlike Intercités, which is funded by the national government, TER is funded by regional governments.</li>

	  <h4 id="luxembourgish-public-transport-tickets">Luxembourgish public transport tickets</h4>
	  <p>The Luxembourgish public transport system is coordinated through the Luxembourgish <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>. The <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/" target="_blank">mobiliteit.lu</a> website gives information regarding all forms of public transport in Luxembourg. There is a mobiliteit.lu journey planner app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cdt" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mobiliteit-lu/id434829995?mt=8&ls=1" target="_blank">iOS</a>), and a separate mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets.</p>
  	  <p>For domestic and some cross-border public transport, Luxembourg has a unified time-based ticketing system. Other than domestic train travel in Luxembourg, the tickets also cover the other Luxembourgish public transport operators: <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus" target="_blank">AVL</a> (Luxembourg City bus; <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?&field_operateurs_value=operateur_avl" target="_blank">list of lines</a>), <a href="http://www.tice.lu/en" target="_blank">TICE</a> (Southwest/Esch-sur-Alzette area bus; <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?&field_operateurs_value=operateur_tice" target="_blank">list of lines</a>), RGTR (countrywide bus; <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?&field_operateurs_value=operateur_rgtr" target="_blank">list of lines</a>), and <a href="http://www.luxtram.lu/" target="_blank">Luxtram</a> (one line).</p> 
<h5 id="types-of-tickets">Types of tickets</h5>
<p>The range of Luxembourgish tickets advertised on the websties/apps of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-au-luxembourg" target="_blank">CFL</a>, <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs" target="_blank">AVL</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-nationaux" target="_blank"><em>Verkéiersverbond</em></a> are slightly different, but they are the same Luxembourgish tickets. The most common Luxembourgish tickets are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Short time ticket (<em>Kuerzzäitbilljee</em> / <em>Billet courte durée</em>): €2 second class, €3 first class, valid for two hours from validation.</li>
	<li>Day ticket (<em>Dagesbilljee</em> / <em>Billet longue durée 1 jour</em>): €4 second class, €6 first class, valid till 04:00 the following day from validation.</li>
	<li>1 day group ticket (<em>Gruppenbilljee 1 Dag</em> / <em>Billet de groupe longue durée 1 jour</em>): €12 second class, ticket for 5 people, valid till 04:00 the following day from validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>carnets</em>: bundles of 10 short time tickets for the price of 8, or 5 day tickets for the price of 4. There are also 2 and 3 day versions of the 1 day tickets (<em>Dagesbilljee 2/3 Deeg</em>); their costs are just multiples of a 1 day ticket.</p>
<p>These Luxembourgish tickets give unlimited transfers amongst the modes of public transport where these tickets are valid (see <a href="#validity-area">below</a>). Passengers have to leave the train/bus/tram that they are on before the ticket expires, based on the timetable schedule of that train/bus/tram service. (Fine for not having a valid public transport ticket in Luxembourg is €150.)</p>
<p>Other than these 2-hour and 1/2/3-day tickets, there are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-mensuels" target="_blank">monthly</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels" target="_blank">annual</a> subscriptions. With the monthly and annual subscriptions, there are 'entire network' options, and 'short distance' options. With the 'short distnace' options, you have to nominate an origin and a destination. In the terms and conditions is a hexagon map (the monthly and annual subscription hexagon maps are slightly different); 'short distance' is maximally six hexagons away from a centre point. If the origin (the 0th hexagon) or the destination (the 6th hexagon) is coloured, then the entire field of coloured hexagons is considered one field / within the zone of validity.</p>
<p>There is a <em>Seniorekaart</em> for people aged 60 or above: €100 <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels/seniorekaart" target="_blank">second class</a>, or €200 <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-au-luxembourg/abonnements-annuels/seniorekaart1ereclasse" target="_blank">first class</a>. It is valid for one year of public transport.</p>
<p>For RégioZone 1 and RégioZone 2 beyond Luxembourg (see <a href="#validity-area">below</a>), there are a short time ticket, a day ticket, a monthly subscription, and an anuual subscription.</p>
<p>For Luxembourg City, the <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/citykaart" target="_blank">Citykaart</a> is a monthly subscription that is valid for all AVL buses, Luxtram, and some RGTR and CFL trains in Luxembourg City; see the validity map in that page.</p>
	  <p>The <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mpass" target="_blank">mPass</a> is given to employees by some companies in Luxembourg for public transport in Luxembourg. For employees living across the border, there are also tag-on deals with public transport in neighbouring Belgium, France, and Germany. See details in that page.</p>

<p>For trains, the domestic tickets cover travels between any train station within Luxembourg (see the <a href="#maps">maps above</a>). For the following stations right across the border:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France are only served by CFL, and are disconnected from the French passenger rail network (physically, and also not bookable through the SNCF website). These two stations are listed like other domestic stations in CFL's <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/gares-et-services/nos-gares" target="_blank">list of stations</a>, and they have Luxembourgish ticket machines. I suppose Luxembourgish domestic tickets are valid for these two stations, but you should ask.</li>
		<li>Athus in Belgium is considered the same tariff point as Rodange in Luxembourg (<a href="images/CFL_Screen_Shot_2018-06-16.png" target="_blank">I asked CFL about this</a>). In other words, Luxembourgish domestic ticketing is extended to Athus. However, there are no CFL ticket machines at Athus. At Athus, you can purchase a Luxembourgish ticket from the CFL app or mTicket app, or from a CFL train conductor (€1 surcharge).</li>
</ul>
<p id="regiozone">For buses and trams, domestic Luxembourgish tickets are valid on AVL buses, TICE buses, RGTR buses, and Luxtram. Domestic Luxembourgish tickets are also valid on RGTR buses to/from some closest-by international localities. For further localities with buses, there are <em>RégioZone 1</em> and <em>RégioZone 2</em> tariff levels, which are concentric from the domestic zone. See <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers/regiozone" target="_blank">this page</a> and the attachements (a list and a map) therein for localities in Belgium, France, and Germany where each of the three levels of tariff applies. (Domestic tariff is <em>Tarifs national</em>.) <em>RégioZone 1</em> and <em>RégioZone 2</em> fares are only valid on RGTR buses and the CFL coach service to <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte-luxemburg-saarbr%C3%BCcken-express" target="_blank">Saarbrücken</a>, not on trains!</p>
<p>All regular cross-border buses are subsumed under RGTR, except for a few Belgian buses; the Wallonian <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> runs a few of its own services to Luxembourg. Luxembourgish tickets are NOT valid on the <a href="https://www.infotec.be/" target="_blank">TEC</a> buses. However, <a href="https://www.infotec.be/fr-be/acheteruntitre/titresettarifs/abonnements.aspx" target="_blank">TEC subscriptions</a> from TEC Namur-Luxembourg <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/tickets-transfrontaliers" target="_blank">are valid</a> on AVL and RGTR buses.</p>
<p>Some monthly and annual subscriptions have a restricted geographical range; see <a href="#types-of-tickets">above</a>.</p> 
<h5 id="channels-of-purchase-and-ticket-media">Channels of purchase and ticket media</h5>
<p>People with a Luxembourgish mobile phone number can <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/se-deplacer/en-bus/titres-de-transport/billets-et-tarifs/sms4ticket" target="_blank">send an SMS to 64222 with <em>A</em> as the content</a> for a 2-hour ticket. It costs €2 for the ticket, and €0.25 for the SMS. Tickets are validated immediately. (You need to have a valid ticket as you board a train/bus/tram; sending this SMS only when you see a ticket inspector is way too late; you will likely get a €150 fine.)</p>
<p>The basic tickets can be purchased from a bus driver or a CFL train conductor (train attendent). All tickets bought from a CFL train conductor have a €1 surcharge. Tickets are validated immediately.</p>
<p>There are the CFL app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.cfl" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/cfl-mobile/id406175215?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>), and the mTicket app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.highQ.mticket" target="_blank">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/mticket/id1343817621" target="_blank">iOS</a>) for mobile phone tickets. The CFL app takes Visa and Mastercard. The mTicket app takes DIGICASH (Luxembourgish bank transfer) and PayPal. With the CFL app, individual tickets, or the first ticket in a carnet, is validated immediately. The rest of the tickets in a carnet has to be validated in the app before usage. When ordering a monthly network subscription in the app, one can choose the starting date of the subscription.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/bornes-automatiques" target="_blank">CFL ticket machines</a> at all train stations in Luxembourg, at Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines in France, but apparently not in Athus in Belgium and other foreign stations served by CFL. The CFL ticket machines sell domestic tickets, and also some cross-border return tickets. <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/fr/Documents/0General/Docs-Caches/How%20to%20operate%20the%20CFL%20ticket%20vending%20machines%20-%20Copy.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is a two-page explanation in English from CFL on how to use the CFL ticket machines, including a list of cross-border tickets available from the ticket machines. In the machine, you can switch between Luxembourgish, French, German, and English languages. The machines take coins, and some cards (Vpay, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro). Very few machines take banknotes. Tickets are validated immediately after purchase.</p>

	  <p>An <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart" target="_blank"><em>mKaart</em></a> – Luxembourg's contactless RFID card – can be obtained for free when purchasing a Luxembourgish public transport ticket at some ticket counters (see <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/titres-de-transport/mkaart#faq" target="_blank"><em>Où est-ce que je peux obtenir ma mKaart ?</em></a>). The card has a validity of five years. There are anonymous cards, and personalised cards. Tickets and subscriptions can be loaded into an mKaart at the aforementioned ticket counters, at the ticket machines of the <em>Verkéiersverbond</em>, or from the mShop website (see next paragraph). This is the <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/sites/default/files/layout-block/files/mkaart-guide-web.pdf" target="_blank">User Guide</a> (May 2017) of mKaart. To validate a ticket: a) if there is just one ticket/carnet in the card, just tap the card on the card reader, and that ticket is validated; b) if there are multiple tickets/carnets in the card, tap the card once on the card reader, the screen then displays the tickets that the card has in it, you press the ticket that you want to validate on the touchscreen, and then you have to tap the card on the card reader again to validate it; c) if you want to validate multiple tickets, e.g., if the card is used by two people using two separate tickets in the card at the same time, repeat the procedures in b).</p>

	  <p>If you already have an mKaart, you can go to the <a href="https://mshop.lu/" target="_blank">mShop</a> website, set up an account / log into your account, and purchase Luxembourgish public transport tickets there. However: a) tickets ordered online are only available after 04:00 the next day; and b) the tickets are not automatically loaded into an mKaart; <a href="https://mshop.lu/pages/pickup" target="_blank">you have to</a> go to a validator, press the pink circle on the top left corner of the touchscreen, and then hold the card on the card reader until the tickets are loaded into the card.</p>

<figcaption>An mKaart reader</figcaption></figure>	  
<p>The <em>Verkéiersverbond</em> has their ticket offices – the <em>Mobilitéitszentral</em> – at Luxembourg and Belval-Université stations. CFL has ticket offices at <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/nos-canaux-de-vente/vente-en-gare" target="_blank">ten stations</a>, where both domestic and international tickets can be purchased. Luxembourg station has a separate international ticket office. Very near the international office (indoor) is an SNCF long-distance train-ticket machine for France.</p>
<p>One can also book international train tickets from the CFL website. For international e-tickets to/from Luxembourg, (I think) you always have to print the ticket out on a piece of A4 paper. There is the Luxembourgish version of the <a href="https://en.oui.sncf/en/collaboration-cfl?ectrans=1" target="_blank">SNCF website</a> for destinations in France, and the Luxembourgish version of the <a href="https://travel.b-europe.com/cfl/travel/booking#TravelWish" target="_blank">NMBS/SNCB booking webpage</a> for destinations in other countries. With the SNCF website, the Luxembourgish version and the French version seem to give the same prices. With the NMBS/SNCB booking webpage, however, it is worth comparing the price given by the Luxembourgish version versus the Belgian version. Also check the international booking webpages of other nearby countries (see links at the <a href="index.html#ticketing-matters">home</a> page).</p>

	  <p>There are short-distance tickets for just across the border, and there are long-distance tickets. For transportation of bicycles, see what <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/fahrrad/bahn_und_fahrrad.shtml" target="_blank">Deutsche Bahn</a> says in German about this.</p>

	<p>Here is a map of the local train lines in <a href="http://www.der-takt.de/fileadmin/karten/RPT_Liniennetzkarte_2017.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Rheinland-Pfalz</em> 'Rhineland-Palatinate'</a> and Saarland (or from <a href="http://www.der-takt.de/service.html" target="_blank">here</a> and then press <em>Liniennetzkarte</em>), the two German states that border Luxembourg.</p>
	  <p>For train travel, there is a special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/tagesr%C3%BCckfahrkarte" target="_blank">day return ticket</a> from any pre-nominated station in Luxembourg to Trier, or just from Wasserbillig (on the border) to Trier at a cheaper price. These tickets can be bought from a ticket machines, or from the CFL app. Child fare is applicable to children between 6 to 11 years old inclusive. Separate outbound and inbound tickets are issued, and they need to be presented together. (I do not understand what the line <em>Les titres doivent être agrafés</em> 'the tickets need to be stapled' (?) in the terms and conditions means; they need to be time-stamped at a validator machine? they need to be physically stapled together?) This day return ticket is also available in the opposite direction from Trier to Luxembourg.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/allemagne/oekocard-wittlich-luxemburg" target="_blank">monthly/annual subscriptions</a> along this line to as far as Wittlich.</p>

(See the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions. Read them very carefully.) The names of the holders have to be written on the ticket. This ticket can be purchased from the CFL ticket machines. (Within Germany, there is also the <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/regio/regionale-tickets/rhldpfalz/rheinland-pfalz-ticket.shtml" target="_blank">Rheinland-Pflaz-Ticket</a>, which is Rheinland-Pfalz-Ticket &#43; Lux minus Luxembourg. <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/regio/regionale-tickets/saar/saarland-ticket.shtml?dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN_-ta-NAVIGATION-regionale-angebote-regionale-tickets-saarland_LZ01" target="_blank">Saarland-Ticket</a> is the same thing as Rheinland-Pflaz-Ticket.)</p>
	  <p>From Germany, <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/en/" target="_blank">VRT</a> (Trier transport authority) has the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tagesticket-delux" target="_blank">day ticket</a> <em>TagesTicket DeLux</em>, and the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-monat" target="_blank">month</a> / <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/mobilticket-delux-jahr" target="_blank">year</a> subscriptions <em>MobilTicket DeLux Monat/Jahr</em>. There are five tariff levels: from <em>Übergangstarifzone 1</em> closest to Luxembourg, to <em>Übergangstarifzone 5</em> covering the entire VRT area. These tickets/subscriptions cover the non-high-speed trains and buses in Luxembourg and the VRT area, but border crossing is restricted to railway across the Igel frontier, <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=401" target="_blank">bus 401</a>, and <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/se-deplacer/horaires-et-reseaux/bus?field_zone_geographique_value=All&field_operateurs_value=All&keys=407" target="_blank">bus 407</a>. This ticket is not valid on Luxembourgish cross-border buses 100, 116, 117, 118, 134, and 157. See also the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/tickets-luxemburg" target="_blank">VRT to Luxembourg page</a> for further illustrations.</p>
	  <p>South of the VRT region, sharing a short border with Luxembourg is the <a href="https://saarvv.de/" target="_blank">saarVV</a> region of Saarland. saarVV tariff extends a little bit into France, but apparently not into Luxembourg. In the opposite direction, Luxembourgish buses extend into Saarland.</p> 
	  <p>The Moselle/Mosel/Musel forms the border between Luxembourg and Germany from Schengen down to Wasserbillig, and is very scenic. Running along the Mosel on the German side is RB 82 Perl – Trier Hbf – Wittlich Hbf. The following are some railway stations right across from Luxembourg: In Saarland, Perl is right across from Schengen, and Nennig is across from Remich. In Rhineland-Palatinate, Wincheringen is across from Wormeldange, Wellen (Mosel) is across from Grevenmacher, and Oberbillig is across from Wasserbillig. South of Perl, passenger trains on this line cross the Apach frontier to Thionville and Metz in France only twice in each direction on Saturday and Sunday (RE 16). SNCF TER runs buses between Thionville and Apach/Perl on Monday to Saturday.</p>
	  <p>For the Luxembourg – Germany – France tripoint region, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering most of the local trains in Saarland (Germany), Lorraine (France), and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (Check the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions; read them very carefully.)</p>
 	      <p>See the <a href="index.html#germany">Germany section in the home page</a> for the local transport tickets that cover the whole Germany.</p>
  	  <h4 id="other-international-tickets-germany">Other international tickets</h4>	  
<p>For Germany, there is a saver fare (i.e. non-flexible fare) called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/allemagne/sparpreis1" target="_blank"><em>Sparpreis Europa</em></a> for international tickets which involve at least one section of travel on long-distance trains (e.g. ICE/IC/EC) in Germany. Before or after the German ICE/IC/EC journey, <em>Sparpries</em> gives a free connecting journey on slower trains (including IC and local trains in Benelux) up to a certain distance. After that, the price increases in increments of €10.</p>
	  <p>With Luxembourg, the free connecting distance is hard to predict: for some journeys, <em>Sparpreis</em> to the entire country costs the same; in other instances, <em>Sparpreis</em> to/from Wasserbillig on the border is €10 cheaper than to/from Luxembourg station. It is best to compare <em>Sparpries</em> to/from Trier Hbf, Wasserbillig, and other destinations in Luxembourg.</p>

	  <p>Also read further in the <a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> page.
	  <h4 id="special-short-distance-cross-border-tickets-belgium">Special short-distance cross-border tickets</h4>	  
<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/belgique-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> between any station in Luxembourg and some near-by stations in Belgium. For the day-return tickets, the following options are available (TGL = any Luxembourgish station; see also the <a href="#maps">maps</a> above):</p>
<ul>
	<li>TGL – Arlon/Messancy via Sterpenich frontier</li>
	<li>TGL – Messancy/Arlon via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Aubange/Halanzy/Virton via Athus</li>
	<li>TGL – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
	<li>Troisvierges – Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts via Gouvy frontier</li>
</ul>
	  <p>(Troisvierges is the northern-most station in Luxembourg, just before the Gouvy frontier.)</p>
<p>CFL ticket machines only sell special day-return ticket tickets to Gouvy/Vielsalm/Trois-Ponts, and for 'Arlon via Sterpenich' and 'Arlon via Athus'. Tickets for Arlon via either route costs the same, but since railway companies are very particular about which frontier a passenger cross for international travel, you better not mix these two routes and their corresponding tickets up. The other destinations to the west of Luxembourg cost the same as Arlon, except for Messancy via Sterpenich, and Virton, both of which are more expensive than the Arlon tickets. (Although costing the same, I assume you cannot use an 'Arlon via Athus' ticket for Halanzy/Aubange/Messancy via Athus? Please ask.)</p> 
	  <p>For children: a) in Luxembourg, children 12 or younger travel for free; b) in Belgium, children 5 or younger travel for free, children 6 to 11 inclusive travel for free if accompanied by a passenger 12 or older with a valid ticket, and each such passenger can take along at most four children 6 to 11 years old for free; otherwise a child needs to have a child ticket.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/belgique/abonnement-mensuel-belgique" target="_blank">monthly subscriptions</a> have destinations further in Belgium, and includes other public transport in Luxembourg. One commonality between these special-priced tickets/subscription is that <em>they CANNOT be combined with another Belgian domestic ticket on the same train</em>. For instance, do not board the IC from Luxembourg to Arlon with one of these special day return tickets, and then stay on the same train beyond Arlon with a Belgian domestic ticket.</p>
<p>The exact same range of tickets/subscriptions are also offered by NMBS/SNCB (Belgian Rail) in the opposite direction, with the same rules about not combining with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train.</p>
	  <h4 id="other-international-tickets-belgium">Other international tickets</h4>	  
	  <p>For Belgium, other than full-flex tickets, there are also the mid-flex tickets of <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/weekend" target="_blank">weekend return</a> (depart on Fri/Sat/Sun, return on Sat/Sun), and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/youth1" target="_blank">youth single/return</a> (for people 25 years or younger). These give 30&#37; off full fare.</p> 
	<p>Otherwise, there are also the no-flex 30-day return tickets called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/escapade" target="_blank">Escapade 1/2/3</a> (€55/77/99 second class, or €90/140/190 first class, for 1/2/3 people), and the youth version called <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/belgique/pass-partout-26-ans" target="_blank">Pass Partout</a> (€22 second class per person return), between any pre-nominated station in Luxembourg and any pre-nominated station in Belgium. (Pass Partout seems to be only available from Luxembourg.) With these normal international tickets, unlike the special cross-border return tickets, you can use them in combination with another Belgian domestic ticket in the same train (<a href="images/B_International_Screen_Shot_2018-06-12.png" target="_blank">I asked NMBS/SNCB International about this</a>).</p>
<p>An international ticket that has its origin or destination in a <a href="belgium.html#Zone">Zone</a> in Belgium automatically gives the traveller, on the ticket's date of validity, free travel on NMBS/SNCB trains within that Zone until they leave the zone.</p>
<h3 id="netherlands">Train deals with the Netherlands</h3>
	  <p>Also read further in the <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> page.
	  <p>For the Netherlands, going via Belgium, firstly there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/pays-bas/early-bird-week-early-bird-weekend" target="_blank">Early Bird</a> deal: fixed discount when booked seven or more days ahead of the departure date, on non-high-speed trains. The discount is on average 40&#37; for Monday to Thursday departures, and 20&#37; for Friday to Sunday departures. There are equivalent deals from Belgium to the Netherlands, and from the Netherlands to Belgium, or to Luxembourg via Belgium. In the Netherlands, with an international ticket, the <a href="netherlands.html#surcharges">ICd surcharge</a> is not applicable. Something that I have only seen mentioned in the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/fr/Documents/Billets-Abonnements/EARLY_BIRD_18_04_09_inet.pdf" target="_blank">CFL terms and condition for the Early Bird deal</a> is that the <a href="netherlands.html#surcharges">ICE surcharge in the Netherlands </a> is also not applicable. (But the ICE surcharge in Belgium is applicable.) If booking this deal from the Netherlands, it is best to do so online; the Dutch ticket machines and the normal ticket counters only sell full fare tickets, while the NS International ticket counters and telephone booking usually charge hefty booking fees.</p>    
<p>Another deal, only available from CFL, is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/pays-bas/nederland-speciaal" target="_blank"><em>Nederland Speciaal</em></a>: 40&#37; discount for a 30-day return ticket, between any station in Luxembourg and any station in the Netherlands. With this deal, the transit route between Luxembourg and the Netherlands has to be (Troisvierges) –[Gouvy frontier]– Liège –[Visé frontier]– (Maastricht).</p>
<p>For the Netherlands, usually going through Belgium is faster and cheaper. However, it is also worth checing options going through Germany instead, especially if the discounts via Belgium are not available to you, and/or if you are going to places in the Netherlands close to the German border. Even for Amsterdam, if you book late, it is worth comparing prices going through Belgium versus Germany.</p>

<p>There are special <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/luxembourg-lorraine-1-jour" target="_blank">day return tickets</a> from any station in Luxembourg to Thionville/Metz/Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier on TER trains (not TGV trains). These tickets are also sold from CFL ticket machines. Child fare is applicable to children 4 to 11 years old inclusive. There seems to be an equivalent ticket sold in <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est/offres/forfaits/lorraine/lorraine_ticket-lorraine-luxembourg" target="_blank">France</a> in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there seems to be no special day tickets to Longwy and beyond via the Rodange frontier. When buying an international ticket to Longwy, just get a domestic Luxembourgish ticket, and an international ticket between Rodange and Longwy or further. That short international section between Rodange and Longwy is quite expensive. Getting an international ticket all the way from Luxembourg City to Longwy is horrendously expensive, based on what SNCF charges on the internet. (If you have time, just catch a RGTR bus between Rodange and Longwy; the RGTR bus to Longwy is covered by domestic Luxembourgish tickets.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/le-pass-luxembourg-hebdomadaire" target="_blank">weekly</a>, <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexway" target="_blank">monthly</a>, and <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/abonnements-internationaux/france/flexjunior" target="_blank">youth monthly</a> subscriptions. These cover all train stations in Luxembourg and till some point on the TER line towards Nancy via the Bettembourg frontier, or to Longwy via the Rodange frontier. The monthly subscriptions also cover other forms of public transport in Luxembourg. For departures from Luxembourg, these subscriptions can be purchased by anyone in Luxembourg. In the other direction, they can only be purchased by residents of Lorraine (the French region south of Luxembourg).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/france/gare-lorraine-express" target="_blank">Gare Lorraine Express</a> bus (to the station of Lorraine TGV) has tickets of its own, and this service must be pre-booked.</p>
	<p>For the Luxembourg – Germany – France tripoint region, there is the <a href="http://www.cfl.lu/espaces/voyageurs/en/billets-et-abonnements/billets-internationaux/saar-lor-lux/saar-lor-lux" target="_blank">Saar-Lor-Lux</a> ticket, which costs €26/36/46/56/66 for 1/2/3/4/5 people for one Saturday or one Sunday, covering nearly all the local trains in Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, and some bordering regions. (See the validity area and other rules in the terms and conditions; read them very carefully.)</p>

This is the website of <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/grand-est" target="_blank">SNCF TER Grand Est</a> (local railway network of the region to the south of Luxembourg).</p>

<p>For France, TGV and OUIGO has dynamic pricing (i.e. book early for the best price), while TER has fixed price. SNCF charges a horrendous amount for connecting train trips within Luxembourg. For TGV, book till Luxembourg; for TER, book till Bettembourg (if you do not have a special Lorraine–Luxembourg day return ticket). Get domestic Luxembourgish tickets from Luxembourg/Bettembourg if you have to travel further in Luxembourg.</p>
	  <h3 id="england">England</h3>
	  <p>There are no special deals between Eurostar and Luxembourg. The most direct connections from Luxembourg to Eurostar are: a) TGV Luxembourg to Paris Est &gt; walk or metro one stop to Paris Nord &gt; Eurostar; b) InterCity Luxembourg to Brussels-Midi/Zuid &gt; Eurostar. The cheapest way would be catching a CFL train to Athus (domestic Luxembourgish ticket), and then use an <a href="belgium.html#UKABS">Any Belgian Station</a> + Eurostar ticket from Athus (but Belgian trains only go to Athus on weekdays/non-Belgian holidays). You can also get a NORMAL FULL-FARE Luxembourg &gt; Arlon international ticket, and then use an Any Belgian Station + Eurostar ticket from Arlon on the Luxembourg &gt; Brussels IC (you can do this; <a href="images/B_International_Screen_Shot_2018-06-12.png" target="_blank">I asked NMBS/SNCB International about this</a>; just make sure that you are not using a special day-return ticket between Luxembourg and Arlon, as these special day tickets cannot be combined with a Belgian domestic ticket on the same train).</p>
