        <p>Greetings! The following are some of my experiences with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I haven't done much research on the guides and tips published by other people. Some details that I provide below could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned; I have credited all data and methods that I learnt from other people, and any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. (I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable for any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.)</p>
        
<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
        <p>There are eight species of flowers in the game. (Excluding lily of the valley, which occationally spawns near cliff edges when an island has a 5-star rating at 05:00 AM, and weeds.) Three colours – most usually red, white, and yellow – of each species can be grown directly from seed bags. The upgraded store on an island sells three species of seeds: two are of the native flowers of the island (often called the 'native flower' and the 'sister flower'), and the remaining one depends on the seasonality at the island (i.e. which month, and whether the island is in the northern or southern hemisphere). Leif sells some seeds that are not available at the shop. Otherwise you would have to rely on other people's islands for seeds that you can't get on your island.</p>
        <p>Beyond the basic three colours, there are three to six extra colours of a species ('hybrid flowers') that can result from a pair of flowers of the same species breeding with each other. A flower has a chance of breeding with another flower at the next turn of the day (05:00 AM, or the first time the game is started thereafter) if it meets all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it is planted in the ground; ground here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path</li>
          <li>it is not planted on the beach (planting a flower on the beach is one way of keeping the flower but preventing it from breeding, and from growing)</li>
          <li>it has been watered by a player or an animal villager, or it has been rained/snowed on</li>
          <li>it is adjacent to another flower of the same species orthogonally or diagonally (i.e. in the adjacent eight tiles), AND that this other flower has not bred with another flower at the next turn of the day</li>
          <li>these two flowers are in their flowering stage (fully matured flower stage) or budding stage (one day before a flower becomes a full flower), stages that you can already tell their colours. (If a flower is planted in the ground, it does not need water to grow towards the flowering stage; if it is planted on the beach, it retains the state that it was planted in and does not grow)</li>
          <li>there is at least one tile that is empty ground in the surrounding tiles. For 'ground', see the definition above; by 'empty', nothing can be placed or dropped on that tile, have fallen on that tile, or burried in that tile. A tile that is half or entirely on a different level (cliff, water, beach) does not count</li>
        </ul>
	      <p>If all the conditions are satisfied, there is a chance that two flowers of the same species would breed with each other, resulting in a bud spawing in a neighbouring empty ground tile.</p>
	      <p>If there is no flower of the same species in the surrounding tiles (on the same level), or if all the flowers of the same species in the surrounding tiles (on the same level) have already bred with other flowers at the next turn of the day, but the other conditions above are fulfilled, then there is a chance that that flower self-replicates the next day, resulting in a new bud with the same genes.</p>
        <p>Flowers of the same species and colour planted directly from seed bags have the same genetic make up. They are the safest starting point for breeding programs. As for the native flowers at the beginning of an island, they also have the same genetic make up as the seed flowers. However, unless you manage to dig them up on the first day, it is possible that new buds have already spawn the next day; they can have the same colour as their parent(s), but their genes can be different. Add one more day and they are already fully grown. Hence treat the existing flowers at the beginning of an island with caution, especially the flowers in the upper two levels, as it take some days at the beginning of the game before one can reach the upper levels.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the basic-colour flowers encountered in the mystery island tours (the small islands reached by using a Nook Mile Ticket at the airport) have the same genetic make up as the seed bag seeds, and are hence safe substitute for seed flowers in breeding programs. (When the game was published in March 2020, there were some mystery islands with hybrid-colour flowers, but the hybrid-flower islands have since been removed from the game.) Remember to transplant the plant with a spade; flowers picked by hand will not grow again!</p>
        <p>The following outlines the breeding programs that I used to breed hybrid flowers. Some hybrid flowers have very low chances of spawning. There are two types of approaches on how to increase the chance of getting such rare hybrids:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mass-breeding: having a large quantity of 'low probability parents', in the hope that one rare hybrid might spawn</li>
          <li>selective-breeding: having step-wise breeding programs (often complicated), increasing the chance of getting a rare hybrid with each generation</li>
        </ul>
<p>Elements of them are not mutually exclusive; mass-breeding-type programs sometimes involve a small number of steps. Selective-breeding-type programs  also benefit from having more participants in each step. I prefer the selective-breeding apprach; I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least twenty-five percent. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increases the chance of error.) There are multiple methods for the reaching same goal. Within each of the two types of approaches, it is possible to evaluate which method is more optimal. However, between the two types of approaches, it is perhaps imposible to tell which type of approach creates the desired hybrid faster. With the low probability in a mass-breeding-type program, a desired hybrid flower can spawn anytime from the next day if one is extremely lucky to 'never' if one is extremely unlucky. In some cases it is possible/feasible/desirable to use both approaches concurrently to increase one's chances.</p>
	<p>Before we move on, we have to talk a little bit about the genetics of the flowers in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I benifited greatly from Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#heading=h.8ezjcm1008jf" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a>, which was updated with the complete flower genetics datamined by Aeter, outlined in Aeter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/edit#gid=528655130" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Research</a>. See both documents and links therein. (To be honest, I haven't dug very deep...) With the breeding methods below, some of them are I have simply followed Paleh's methods; some of them I have devised myself, calculated from the complete gene tables.</p>		
		<p>(Unless a flower self-replicates,) the inheritance of genes from two parents basically follows Mendelian inheritance. All flowers have three active allele pairs (three out of four possible types), except for roses which have four active allele pairs. The four possible types are labled Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss by Paleh. The allele pairs are coded binarily in the game as 00, 01, or 11. The child receives one random allele from each allele pair from each parent. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allele pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive, except for Ww where 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive. In parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code of 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 for binary 00 (recessive–recessive rr, yy, ss, and dominant–dominant WW)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 for binary 01 (dominant–recessive Rr, Yy, Ww, Ss)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 for binary 11 (dominant–dominant RR, YY, SS, and recessive–recessive ww)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the genetic make up of the flowers. Roses are described by a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220, in other words binary 11 11 11 00, or Paleh's RR YY ww ss. Other flowers are described by a string of three ternary numbers for their three active allele pairs.</p>
	      <p>The results of two allele pairs combining can be:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>0 and 0: 0 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>0 and 2: 1 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>2 and 2: 2 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>1 and 0: 1 or 0 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 2: 1 or 2 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 1: 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 (25&#37; each)</li>
	      </ul>
<p>As can be inferred, having two roses 1111 (pink) breeding with each other is the most chaotic, with all 81 gene combinations (3 to the power of 4) being possible outcomes. Exactly one of them is the blue rose 2220, at a probability of 1/81 (&asymp;1.23&#37;).</p>
