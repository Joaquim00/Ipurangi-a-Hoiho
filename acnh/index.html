        <p>Greetings! The following are some of my experiences playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some details that I provide below could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned (honestly I haven't done much research on similar guides published by other people); I have credited all data and methods that I learnt from other people, while any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable for any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.</p>
        
<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
        <p>Seeds of eight species of flowers exist in the game. Each comes in three colours; except for windflowers, of which the 'seed colours' are white, orange, and red, the seed colours for the other seven species are white, yellow, and red. Beyond the three basic seed colours, two flowers of the same species can breed and create hybrid flowers of three to six other colours, depending on the species. This section outlines my methods for breeding these hybrid colours for each species.</p>
	      <h4 id="preliminaries">
<a id="preliminaries" class="anchor" href="#preliminaries" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminaries</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the game, two species of flowers exist on the island; one is found on the ground level, and another is found on the not-immediately-reachable upper 'cliff' levels. I call these the 'native flowers'. Many people call one the 'native flower' and the other the 'sister flower'.</p>
<p>The primary ways of obtaining seeds is from the tent/shop, and from Leif. At the tent stage, three types of seeds are available. At the small shop stage, six types of seeds are available: two colours of three species. At the large shop stage, nine types of seeds are available: three colours of three species. At the large shop stage, two of the species are the native flowers of the island, and the remaining species is another species in season. Leif is a trader that comes one day per week during Monday to Friday, after residence service has been upgraded. (Update 1.2.0 / 23 April 2020 of the game is required.) He sells some seeds of flower species that are not sold at the shop. Otherwise you have to rely on other players for seeds that they have or are sold on their island.</p>
        <p>A flower has a chance of breeding with another flower at the next turn of the day (05:00 AM) if it meets all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the flower is planted in the ground; ground here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path</li>
          <li>the flower has been watered by a player or an animal villager, or it has been rained/snowed on (a flower becomes unwatered again after potential breeding at the next turn of the day, or time travelling to an earlier time)</li>
          <li>the flower is adjacent to another flower of the same species orthogonally or diagonally (i.e. in the adjacent eight tiles), AND that this other flower has not bred with another flower at the next turn of the day</li>
          <li>these two flowers are in their bud stage or full flower stage. (When planted from a seed bag, on the first day a flower is a sprout, the second day a stem, the third day a bud, and the fourth day a fully grown flower. At the bud and full flower stages its colour is visible. If the flower is planted in the ground, it does not need water to grow towards the flowering stage. A new flower that spawns from other flowers starts as a bud)</li>
          <li>with the tiles adjacent to the flowers, at least one of them is an empty ground tile. For 'ground', see the definition above; by 'empty', nothing can be placed or dropped on that tile, have fallen on that tile, or burried in that tile. An adjacent tile that is partially or entirely on a different level (cliff, water, beach) also does not qualify</li>
        </ul>
	   <p>If all the conditions are satisfied, then there is a chance that the two flowers breed with each other, with an offspring budding in an adjacent empty ground tile.</p>
	      <p>If there is no flower of the same species in the adjacent tiles (on the same level), or if all the flowers of the same species in the adjacent tiles (on the same level) have already bred with other flowers, and all the other conditions are satisfied, then there is a chance that that flower self-replicates as a bud in an adjacent tile at the turn of the day.</p>   
	      <p>Having players from other islands watering a flower increases the probability that that flower breeds with other flowers (or self-replicate) at the next turn of the day. The probability does not rise further when watering is done by more than five players from other islands.</p>     
	      <p>Plants that are planted in the beach area do not grow or breed. Planting a flower in the beach area is one way of keeping the flower but preventing it from breeding.</p>     
	      <p>Flowers of the same colour and species grown from seed bags have the same genetic make up. This make seed bags the safest starting point for breeding programs. As for the native flowers at the beginning of an island in the game, they also have the same genetic make up as the seed-bag flowers. However, unless you manage to dig them up on the first day, it is possible that new buds could have already spawn the next day; some have the same colour as their parent(s), but their genotypes can be different. Add one more day and the newly spawn flowers are already fully grown flowers, making it often impossible to tell whether a basic-colour flower on the island has the same genes as seed-bag flowers or not by the third day. The existing flowers on a player's island are hence usually unreliable for breeding programs. This is especially the case with the flowers on the upper two levels, as normally it take some days at the beginning of the game before a player can reach the upper levels.</p>
        <p>On a mystery-tour island (small island reached by using a Nook Mile Ticket at the airport), one can encounter one of the two native flower species, in their basic colours. These flowers have the same genetic make up as the seed-bag flowers, and are hence safe use for breeding programs. Remember to transplate the flower with a spade! Flowers picked by hand cannot grow again! (Between the roll-out of the game on 23 March 2020 and update 1.2.0 on 23 April 2020, some mystery-tour islands had hybrid-colour flowers on them. These hybrid islands have since been removed.)</p>
        <p>The following outlines the breeding programs that I used for breeding hybrid flowers. Some hybrid flowers have very low probability of spawning from seed-bag flowers or early-generation hybrids. There are two types of approach for increasing the chance of such hybrids spawning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mass-breeding: having a large pool of low-probability parents breeding with each other, hoping that one rare hybrid would spawn out of a large quantity of low-probability parents</li>
          <li>selective-breeding: having step-wise breeding programs (often complicated), improving the spawn rate of rare hybrids with each generation</li>
        </ul>
<p>Elements of these two types of approach are not mutually exclusive; mass-breeding-type programs often involve a small number of steps, and selective-breeding-type programs also benefit from having more participants in each step. I prefer the selective-breeding apprach; I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least twenty-five percent. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increases the chance of error; a high level of caution is needed at each step.)</p> 
	   <p>There are often multiple methods for reaching the same goal. Within each of the two types of approach, it is often possible to evaluate which one out of two methods is more optimal. On the other hand, it is perhaps imposible to evaluate across the two types of approach. A selective-breeding-type approach is more controlled (if done correctly); the range of time that it takes between the start of the breeding program and the spawning of a rare hybrid is conceptually easier to model. A mass-breeding-type approach has a low spawning rate of such rare hybrids; with less control over the spawning rate of such rare hybrids, one could be extremely lucky and have a rare hybrid spawn the next day with just two low-probability parents, or one could be extremely lucky and 'never' encounter a rare hybrid with the low-probability parents. In some cases it is feasible/desirable to use both approaches concurrently to increase one's chances.</p>
	<p>Before we move on, we have to talk a little bit about the genetics of the flowers in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I benifited greatly from Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#heading=h.8ezjcm1008jf" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a>, which was updated with the complete flower genetics datamined by Aeter, outlined in Aeter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/edit#gid=528655130" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Research</a>. I suggest looking through these two resources, and also the links therein. (To be honest, I haven't dug very deep...) Also very useful is the <a href="https://gardenscience.ac/" traget="_blank">Flower Breeding Simulator</a> by AeonSake. With the breeding methods below, some of them I simply followed Paleh's methods; others I have devised myself, calculated from the complete gene tables.</p>		
		<p>(Unless a flower self-replicates,) gene inheritance of the flowers basically follows Mendelian inheritance. All flowers have three active allele pairs, except for roses which have four allele pairs. Paleh labels the alleles Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss. (The three-allele-pair flowers have either RYW or RYS.) Aeter lables the alleles R, Y, W, and roses have an extra B. (Or alternatively, G1, G2, G3, G4 respectively.) The allele pairs are coded in the game as binary 00, 01, or 11. The offspring receives one random allele from each allele pair from each parent. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allele pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) Using Paleh's nomenclature, 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive for Rr, YY, and Ss, while 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive for Ww. In parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code of 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 = binary 00 (recessive–recessive rr, yy, ss, and dominant–dominant WW)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 = binary 01 (dominant–recessive Rr, Yy, Ww, Ss)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 = binary 11 (dominant–dominant RR, YY, SS, and recessive–recessive ww)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the flower genotypes. Roses are described using a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220, in other words binary 11 11 11 00, or Paleh's RR YY ww ss. Other flowers are described using a string of three ternary numbers for their three active allele pairs.</p>
	      <p>When allele pairs from two parents combine, the offspring allele pair is:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>0 and 0: 0 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>0 and 2: 1 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>2 and 2: 2 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>1 and 0: 1 or 0 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 2: 1 or 2 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 1: 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 (25&#37; each)</li>
	      </ul>
<p>As can be inferred, having two pink roses 1111 breeding with each other is the most chaotic scenario possible, with all 81 gene combinations (3*3*3*3) being possible outcomes. Exactly one of them is the blue rose 2220, at a probability of 1/(4*4*4*4) = 0.390625&#37;.</p>

	      <p>Lilies are the easiest. The seed-bag flowers are: white 002, yellow 020, and red 201. There are three hybrid colours: orange, black, and pink. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for orange, black, pink.</p>

		</code></blockquote>
<p>Any red offsprings of two seed 201s are also seed 201, and can be used again for this method. Two black 200s breeding with each other can only result in black 200s, and two pink 202 breeding with each other can only result in pink 202s.</p>
<p>An alternative method for obtaining pink lelies is mixing seed white and seed red parents.</p>
	  <blockquote></code>
	  parents: seed white 002, seed red 201</br>
	offsprings: <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (50&#37;)
	  </code></blockquote>
<p>Two pink 101 breeding with each other produces red (25&#37;), pink (31.25&#37;), white (37.5&#37;), or black 200 (6.25&#37;).</p>

	      <h5>black cosmos</h5>
	      <p>Black cosmos can be obtained by breeding two orange cosmos. In the preceeding section, a seed yellow and a seed red are used to breed orange 110 or orange 111 (5050&#37 each). However, the spawn rate for black cosmos is very low for orange 110 and orange 111, with orange 111 being the worst out of all the orange cosmos genotypes (with one rare exception). There is a hierarchy of the seven possible orange cosmos genotypes in terms of their spawn rate of black cosmos when breeding with other orange cosmos: 111 &lt; 110 &lt; 122 &lt; [121~211] &lt; [120~210], with 111 being the worst, and 210 being the best (with the exception that two 122s cannot spawn black cosmos; also, 122, 121, and 120 are rare). The following table outlines the probability that a spawning bud is black when two orange cosmos breed with each other.</p>

	<p>Instead of simply having a large field of orange 111s and 110s, I have both a mass breeding area and a separate selective breeding area, which usually produces orange cosmos with better genes. In the selective breeding area, I breed any orange buds that spawn in either breeding area with a seed red cosmos 200. I wait till that orange cosmos produce another orange offspring (with the seed red cosmos) before I move the original orange cosmos to the mass breeding area. The spawn rate of orange cosmos offsprings in the selective breeding area is at least 50&#37;, and in the mass breeding area at least 40.625&#37;.</p> 
	      <p>With orange 111, 110, 211, and 210, breeding one of them against a seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 50&#37; of the time. The resulting orange offspring will either have the same genes as the original orange cosmos or have better genes: 111 produces 111, 110, 211, or 210 (25&#37; each out of the orange offsprings); 110 produces 110 or 210 (50&#37; each out of the orange offsprings); 211 produces 211 or 210 (50&#37; each out of the orange offsprings), 210 produces 210.</p>
	      <p>With orange 122, 121, and 120, breeding it against seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 100% of the time. Half of them will have improved genes (211 or 210), while half of them will have less optimal genes (111 or 110). However, 122, 121 and 120 are relatively rare: they can only appear as new buds in the mass breeding area and not the selective breeding area (breeding orange cosmos with a seed red 200 does not produce 122/121/120), and a larger number of flowers participating in the initial selective breeding area could keep the number of 122, 121, and 120 in the mass breeding area relatively low. Even if 111s or 110s were produced, the new 111s or 110s can usually produce new orange offsprings with better genes in the selective breeding area.</p>
	      <p>The following are the possible offsprings of the seven types of orange cosmos when bred with seed red 200 (their probabilities are the same within each row):</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>orange 111: orange 111, orange 110, orange 211, orange 210, pink 100, pink 101, red 200, red 201</li>

	      <p>Firstly, the offspring red 101 is the same as the parent red 101. Excess red 101 can be used for mass breeding: the spawn rate for purple 202 is 1/16 = 6.25&#37;.</p>
	      <p>Secondly, in this step 3, there are two types of blue offsprings: the 'bad' blue 002, and the 'good' blue 102. They can be tested with a seed yellow 020: with the 'bad' blue 002, the only possible offsprings are yellow 011; with the 'good' blue 102, half of the offsprings are yellow 011, and others are orange 111. When a blue pansy from step 3 breeds with a seed yellow 020, if the there are four yellow offsprings in a row, then the chances that it is a 'good' blue 102 is too low, and can be removed from the breeding program. (You can't be absolutely sure that it is a blue 002 either, so best not to feed this blue pansy back to step 3.) A single orange offspring can confirm that the blue pansy is a 'good' blue 102 pansy. (If the offspring is blue, then the blue pansy has self-duplicated.)</p>

<p>Both orange 110 and yellow 111 can be used to mass-breed purple hyacinths, with all three combinations (110–110, 110–111, 111–111) having a spawn rate of purple offsprings at 1/16 = 6.25&#37;. You may want to have separate mass-breeding fields of orange and yellow hyacinths (but make sure that it is a yellow 111 that is added to the mass-breeding field, and not a self-duplicated seed yellow 020). With both the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields, any orange offsprings can be added to the orange mass-breeding field: orange 110 plus orange 110 spawns orange 110 at 25&#37;, and orange 120 at 12.5&#37;; yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawns orange 110 at 6.25&#37;, and orange 120 at 3.125&#37;. However, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow  mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many will not lead to purple hyacinths.</p>
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple hyacinths: orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;; orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;; orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120 is to separate out any orange buds from the orange or yellow mass-breeding fields, have it breed with a seed yellow 020, and move it back to the orange mass-breeding field after it has produced one orange offspring. Feed this orange offspring back into breeding with a seed yellow 020 and repeat the process. A orange 110 plus a seed yellow 020 spawn orange 110 at 25&#37;, orange 120 at 25&#37;, (yellow 010 at 25&#37;, yellow 020 at 25&#37;). While this process increases the chance of spawning purple hyacinths in the orange mass-breeding field, it is doubtful that this speeeds up the process of spawning purple hyacinths. And if blue hyacinths are desired, two orange 120s breeding with each other do not result in blue hyacinths.</p>
	      <p>In the orange mass-breeding field, orange 110–orange 110 and orange 110–orange 120 spawn blue 210 at 12.5&#37;. Two blue 210s breeding with each other spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;, the same blue 210 at 5025&#37;(, and red 200 at 25&#37;). (On the other hand, orange 120–orange 120 do not spawn blue hyacinths. Blue hyacinths spawn in the yellow mass-breeding field can be either blue 210 or blue 002, and hence it is best not to use blue hyacinths from the yellow mass-breeding field.)</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple hyacinths, purple hyacinths from two orange hyacinths are purple 210; purple hyacinths from one orange hyacinth and one yellow hyacinth (111 or 121) can be purple 210 or 211; purple hyacinths from two yellow hyacinths (111 or 121) can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple hyacinths breeding with each other will only result in purple hyacinths.</p>
	      <h5>blue hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Blue hyacinths can be obtained during the process of obtaining purple hyacinths (see the previous section). An easier way of obtaining blue hyacinths is breeding two seed white 001s: the offsprings are white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), blue 002 (25&#37;). However, this blue 002 will not spawn purple hyacinths when bred with each other, unlike the blue 210 which can be obtained from two orange 110 (see previous section).</p>
	      <h5>pink hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Seed white 001 plus seed red 201 results in the following offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;). Pink tulips can also appear in the yellow mass-breeding field (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn 101 at 6.25&#37;.</p> 
		<p>All pink hyacinths are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (37.5&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (31.25&#37;), blue 002 (6.25&#37;).</p>

While this process increases the chance of spawning purple tulips in the orange mass-breeding field, it is doubtful that this speeeds up the process of spawning purple tulips. And if black tulips are desired, two orange 120s breeding with each other do not result in black tulips.</p>
	      <p>In the orange mass-breeding field, orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn black tulips at 18.75&#37;, consisting of black 200 (6.25&#37;) and black 210 (12.5&#37;). Orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn only black 210 (12.5&#37;). (Orange 120 plus orange 120 does not spawn black tulips.) In the yellow mass-breeding field (all of them have to be yellow 111), black 200 spawn at 1.5625&#37;, and black 210 spawn at 3.125&#37;. Black 210 is the good one, and these two types of black tulips can be tested with a seed white 001. Black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn yellow, orange, red, or pink offsprings, while black 200 plus seed white 001 only spawn red or pink offsprings</p> 
	      <p>Test: </p>
	      <p>If none of the first four offsprings are yellow or orange, then the probability that the black tulip is black 210 is getting too low, and can be removed from the breeding program.</p>		      
	      <p>In addition to waiting for a purple tulip to spawn in the orange and yellow mass breeding fields, if you can get hold of black 210s, two black 210s spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>	      
	      <p>Step</p>		      
	      <p>The black offsprings can be fed back into the black-plus-seed-white tulip test described above.</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple tulips, purple tulips from two orange tulips are purple 210; purple tulips from one orange  and one yellow tulip 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple tulips from two yellow tulips 111 can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple tulips breeding with each other only result in purple tulips.</p>
	      <h5>black tulips</h5>
	      <p>Black tulips can be obtained during the process of obtaining purple tulips (see the previous section). An easier way of obtaining black tulips is breeding two seed red 201s: the offsprings are black 200 (25&#37;), seed red 201 (50&#37;), red 202 (25&#37;). However, this black 200 will not spawn purple tulips when bred with each other, unlike the black 210 which can be obtained from orange or yellow tulips (see previous section).</p>
	      <h5>pink tulips</h5>
	      <p>Seed white 001 plus seed red 201 results in the following offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;). Pink tulips can also appear in the yellow mass-breeding field (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn 101 at 6.25&#37;. If you are testing black tulips (see above), black 200 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 50&#37;, while black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 25&#37;.</p> 
		<p>All pink tulips are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (31.25&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (37.5&#37;), black 200 (6.25&#37;).</p>
