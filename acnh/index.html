        <p>Greetings! The following are some tips from my experience playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I am simply outlining the methods that I have used and/or devised; they are not necessarily the best practices (e.g. in some cases, I have since read about better methods), although I do try to point out the pros and cons of them. I haven't read widely into guides published by other people; some of the details that I provide could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned. I have credited all methods that I learnt from other people, and any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. (Please credit me properly if you have referenced me. I am Hilário#0435 at Discord.) I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable for any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.</p>
	      <p>Take note of the following terms which are used throughout this page (people often use different names for the same concepts outlined below):</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>turn of the day: the in-game day begins at 05:00 AM, according to the game console's system time; daily occurrences are reset at 05:00 AM, or when the game is started/reactivated for the first time after 05:00 AM if the game is not running at 05:00 AM.</li>
		      <li>turn of the week: the in-game week begins on Sunday, functionally speaking. Weekly schedules are reset whenever a turn of the day occurs on a Sunday (including Monday before 05:00 AM), or the first turn of the day thereafter if the game has not been switched on for a Sunday turn of the day, according to the game console's system time. (Time-travelling back to the Sunday of the in-game week will trigger another turn of the week.)</li>

<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
	      <p>In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are eight species of flowers that can breed and result in offsprings of various colours, often colours that are different from those of the parents. In addition, these flowers can self-replicate if there are no valid breeding partners surrounding them. This section is about the methods that I used to create the 'hybrid' flowers, and issues surrounding them.</p>
	      <p>(In addition to the usual flowers, there are also the lilies of the valley, and weeds; their mechanisms for spawning, and growing/replicating for weeds, are different from the usual flowers, and this section has nothing to say about these two types of plants. Please see other guides for lilies of the valley and weeds; they are both interesting in their own ways.)</p>    
	      <h4 id="preliminaries">
<a id="preliminaries" class="anchor" href="#preliminaries" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminaries</h4>
<h5>Obtaining seeds</h5>
	      <p>Fully grown flowers of two species of flowers are found on the player's island at the beginning of the game. One species is found on the ground level, and another species on the upper two 'cliff' levels, which the player is not able to access at the very beginning of the game. One of the two species is also found on the small islands visited during a mystery island tour.</p>       
	      <p>Seeds of eight species of flowers exist in the game. Seeds are available in three colours for each species. The basic 'seed colours' are white, yellow, and red, except for windflowers, of which the seed colours are white, orange, and red. Two flowers of the same species can breed with each other; the resulting offsprings can have the same or different colour as the parents. Beyond the three basic 'seed colours', each species has three to six extra 'hybrid colours', depending on the species.</p>
<p>The primary ways of obtaining flower seed bags are from the service tent / shop, and from Leif. At the tent stage (i.e. before the shop is built), three types of seeds can be purchased at the service tent. At the small shop stage, six types of seeds (three species, two colours of each) are available. At the large shop stage, nine types of seeds (three species, three colours of each) are available. At the large shop stage, two of the species on sale are seeds of the flowers native to the island, while the remaining species is a random in-season species. Leif is a trader that appears after the resident services has been upgraded to a permanent building. (Leif was introduced with the 1.2.0 / 23 April 2020 update; in versions 1.2.x of the game, Leif appears during weekdays once per week. With the 1.3.0 / 3 July 2020 update, Leif typically appears once every two weeks, with a small chance of him appearing in consecutive weeks, still on weekdays.) Leif sells seeds of two out-of-season species.</p> 
	      <p>Occationally, you can receive seed bags in the mail, or find them in the recycle box at the resident services. If you cannot obtain the types of seeds that you want through the aforementioned methods, then you have to rely on other players for seeds that are sold on their island, or seeds that they are willing to give/sell to you.</p>
<h5>Transplanting flowers for breeding</h5>
	      <p>Most flower breeding programs rely on flowers grown from seeds, as flowers grown from seeds of the same colour and species have the same genotype, and hence the most reliable.</p>
	      <p>Flowers that are on a player's island on the first day have the same genes as the seed-bag flowers. FULLY GROWN flowers that are in the immediately accessible part of the island on the FIRST TWO DAYS are OK to be used for breeding programs. Otherwise, flowers could already have offsprings on the second day, and on the third day the offsprings have already become fully grown flowers; the offsprings can have the same colour, but have different genes from the parents, so it is safest to NOT use the pre-existing flowers on the player's island for breeding programs, especially the species found on the cliff levels, as – in normal circumstances – it takes a few days before the player can access the cliff levels.</p>
	       <p>On a mystery-tour island (a small island reached by using a Nook Mile Ticket at the airport), one can encounter one of the two flower species found on the player's main island, in their basic colours. These flowers have the same genes as the seed-bag flowers, and are hence safe use for breeding programs. Conditions on a mystery-tour island do not change across 05:00 AM (normal sunrise/sunset times still apply). (Between the roll-out of the game on 23 March 2020 and update 1.2.0 on 23 April 2020, some mystery-tour islands have hybrid-colour flowers on them. These hybrid-flower islands have since been removed.)</p>
	      <p>As for flowers from other players' islands, if you are connected using the same WiFi network, or if you are 'best friends' with them, then you can use spades on their island; you can either go to their island and dig up a flower, or they can plant their flower on your island. In other cases, you cannot use spades on other peoples' islands; the flower donor/seller has to come to your island to plant their flower on your island. Flowers from other people are more often than not not suitable for breeding programs. Firstly, seeing only the colour of the flower is usually not adequate, as flowers of the same colour and species can have many different genotypes. Perhaps most growers do not care about the genotype of their flowers. With people who know at least a bit about ACNH flower genetics, some are not careful enough, and even with careful growers, mistakes can be made, and sometimes no tests are known for distinguishing two different genotypes. The safest is growing your own flowers from seeds; if you acquire flowers from other people for breeding programs, only use flowers which the grower is 100&#37; confident in saying what its genotype is.</p>
	      <p>(The following flowers only have one possible genotype: blue roses are 2220; golden roses are 0000; pink hyacinths and pink tulips are 101. If breeding only amongst themselves, two purple flowers of the following species can only produce purple offsprings: pansies, windflowers, hyacinths, tulips.)</p>
	      <p>Remember to transplate the flower with a spade! Flowers picked by hand cannot grow again!</p>
<h5>Flowers at the turn of the day</h5>
	<p>Flowers can produce offsprings at the turn of the day. At the turn of the day, the game checks on each flower in a random order. Each flower has its own probability of breeding. If it has been selected to breed that day, it will spawn an offspring if it meets all the following conditions:</p>      
        <ul>
          <li>the flower is planted in the ground: 'ground' here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path; these are types of tile surfaces that can be dug into, excluding sand in the beach area. (A flower can also be planted in the beach, but it will not breed, nor grow)</li>
          <li>the flower has been watered by a player or an animal villager, or it has been rained/snowed on (a flower becomes unwatered again after potential breeding at the turn of the day, or time travelling to an earlier time)</li>
          <li>the flower is in its fully grown stage; a flower in its bud stage becomes full grown at the next turn of the day, and can also breed at that point. (The bud and full flower stages are stages when the colour of a flower is visible. When planted from a seed bag, a flower is a sprout on the first day, a stem on the second day, a bud on the third day, and a fully grown flower on the fourth day. A player running on the flower can revert it back to the bud stage, and picking the flower reverts it back to the stem stage. New flower offprings spawn as buds. While flowers (that are planted in the ground) do not need water to grow, watering it even during its non-breeding stages counts towards the number of days that it has been watered, and can increase its chance of breeding down the line) </li>
		<li>there is at least one empty ground tile orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the flower(s) in question for a new offspring bud to spawn. For two flowers breeding with each other, at least one empty ground tile in the surrounding ten or twelve tiles adjacent to the two flowers; for one flower self-replicating, at least one empty ground tile in the surrounding eight tiles. For 'ground', see the definition above. By 'empty', nothing can be placed or dropped on that tile, have fallen on that tile, or burried in that tile. An adjacent tile that is partially or entirely on a different level (cliff, water, beach) also does not qualify</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>A flower that has been selected for breeding will first seek to breed with a flower in the eight adjacent tiles. It can only breed with that other flower if they are of the same species, and that other flower has not already bred with another flower during that turn of the day. If there are no valid partners in the surrounding eight tiles, the flower will self-duplicate (provided that all other conditions listed above are met).</p>
	      <p>When the breeding conditions are met, the base probability of a flower being picked by the game to breed is 5&#37;. The probability increases with each watering day after four watering days without offpsrings. Bonus probability is added to a flower that has been watered by players visiting from other islands, up to five watering players for a given flower, and only the watering done by the first ten watering visitors in a day counts. The probability is reset back to 5&#37; if the flower produces an offsprings, or if it is dug up. See other guides on the exact mechanisms involved with this spawn probability.</p>      
<h5>Flower genetics in ACNH</h5>   
	<p>I benifited greatly from Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#heading=h.8ezjcm1008jf" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a>, which was updated with the complete flower genetics datamined by Aeter, outlined in Aeter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/edit#gid=528655130" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Research</a>. I suggest looking through these two resources, and also the links therein. (To be honest, I haven't read very widely on this matter...) Also very useful are AeonSake's <a href="https://gardenscience.ac/" traget="_blank">Flower Breeding Simulator</a>, and Yue's <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/garden.html" target="_blank">ACNH garden guides</a>. With the breeding methods below, some of them I have simply followed Paleh's methods, and others I have devised myself, calculated from the complete gene tables.</p>		
	      <p>When a flower self-replicates, the offpsring has the same genes as the parent. When two flowers breed with each other, each parent contribute one allele form each allele pair. Roses have four allele pairs, while other flowers have three allele pairs. Aeter labels the allele pairs G1, G2, G3, and G4 for the extra allele pair that roses have. Alternatively, R, Y, W, and B or S respectiely. Paleh lables the alleles Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss respectively (with the three-allele-pair flowers having either RYW or RYS). The allele pairs are coded in the game as binary 00, 01, or 11. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allele pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) Using Paleh's nomenclature, 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive for Rr, YY, and Ss, while 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive for Ww. According to Paleh, in parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code of 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 = binary 00 (recessive–recessive rr, yy, ss, or dominant–dominant WW)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 = binary 01 (dominant–recessive Rr, Yy, Ww, Ss)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 = binary 11 (dominant–dominant RR, YY, SS, or recessive–recessive ww)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the flower genotypes. Roses are described using a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220, in other words binary 11 11 11 00, or Paleh's RR YY ww ss. Other flowers are described using a string of three ternary numbers for their three allele pairs.</p>
	      <p>When allele pairs from two parents combine, the allele pair in an offspring can be:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>0 and 0: 0 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>0 and 2: 1 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>2 and 2: 2 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>1 and 0: 1 or 0 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 2: 1 or 2 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 1: 0 (25&#37;), 1 (50&#37;), or 2 (25&#37)</li>
	      </ul>
<p>As can be inferred, having two pink roses 1111 breeding with each other is the most chaotic scenario possible, with all 81 gene combinations (3*3*3*3) being possible outcomes. Exactly one of them is the blue rose 2220, at a probability of 1/(4*4*4*4) = 0.390625&#37;.</p>      
<h5>Types of breeding programs</h5>
	      <p>There are multiple paths for breeding a particular hybrid colour. Some hybrid colours can be very easily obtained, while some are very difficult, with the blue rose being the hardest to breed.</p>
	      <p>In relation to her typology of the <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/bluerose.html" target="_blank">blue rose methods</a>, Yue classifies the blue rose methods into 'genepool methods' versus 'methodical paths'. 'Genepool methods' involve the breeding of flowers within a known range of genotypes. However, there is no testing to see which particular genotype a flower has, and only some genotype pairs within the range have a chance of spawning the desired offspring. While this is relatively uncontrolled, with a large number of breeding pairs, the time between the beginning of the program and the first desired rare offspring spawning is not necessarily very long.</p>
	      <p>'Methodical paths' involve programs where the genotypes of the offsprings, and the probability that each type will spawn are known. With this type of programs, I make a distinction between 'mass breeding' versus 'selective breeding":</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(controlled) mass breeding: having a large pool of low-probability parents – of which the exact genotype is known – breeding with each other, hoping that one rare hybrid would eventually spawn</li>
          <li>selective breeding: having programs with more steps, with relatively high probability of the desired output at each step, and raising the probability of the desired ultimate offspring with each step</li>
        </ul>
	      <p>(Using this nomenclature, 'genepool methods' would be 'semi-controlled mass breeding'.)</p>	      
<p>Elements of these two types of approaches are not mutually exclusive; mass-breeding-type programs often involve a small number of steps, and selective-breeding-type programs also benefit from having more participants in each step. I prefer selective breeding: I like the relative certainty, I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least 25&#37;. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increases the chance of error; a high level of caution is needed at each step.) I use selective breeding methods if I can formulate one, or if one is known to me. Sometimes there is an excess of output at a particular step, and often they can be set aside for mass breeding concurrently. (Sometimes, through chance, the desired hybrid spawned quicker in the mass-breeding field, but I always follow through my selective breeding programs.) With black cosmos, I used what can be called an 'funnelled genepool method'; I don't test the genotype of the orange cosmos parents, but I 'gene-funnel' them to gradually 'improve' the genes of the orange cosmos offsprings, which I later feed back into the (semi-controlled) mass-breeding area, theoratically raising the probability of spawning black cosmos to 25&#37;.</p>
<p>The following are the methods that I used for each species of flowers.</p>
	      <h4 id="lilies">
<a id="lilies" class="anchor" href="#lilies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lilies</h4>
	      <p>ユリ / lirios / lys / Lilien / gigli / lelies / лилии / 백합 / 百合 / 百合</p>
	      <p>Lilies are the easiest. The seed-bag flowers are: seed white (002), seed yellow (020), and seed red (201). There are three hybrid colours: orange, black, and pink. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for orange, black, pink.</p>
<h5 id="orangelilies">oragne lilies</h5>
<p>Orange lilies can be obtained from a seed yellow plus a seed red.</p>
	      <blockquote>
		parents: seed yellow 020, seed red 201</br>
	      offsprings: <strong>orange 110 (50&#37;)</strong>, yellow 111 (50&#37;)</br>
	</blockquote>
<h5 id="blackandpinklilies">black and pink lilies</h5>
	  <p>Black and pink lilies can be obtained from a seed red plus a seed red.</p>
	  <blockquote>
		parents: seed red 201, seed red 201</br>
		offsprings: <strong>black 200 (25&#37;)</strong>, seed red 201 (50&#37;), <strong>pink 202 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>
<p>Red offsprings of two seed red 201s are also seed red 201s, and can be used again for this method. Two black 200s breeding with each other can only result in black 200s, and two pink 202 breeding with each other can only result in pink 202s.</p>
<p>An alternative method for obtaining pink lelies is mixing a seed white with a seed red.</p>
	  <blockquote>
	  parents: seed white 002, seed red 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (50&#37;)</br>
	 </blockquote>
<p>Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (25&#37;), pink (31.25&#37;), white (37.5&#37;), or black 200 (6.25&#37;).</p>
<h4 id="cosmos">
<a id="cosmos" class="anchor" href="#cosmos" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cosmos</h4>
	      <p>コスモス / cosmos / cosmos / Kosmeen / cosmee / cosmea / космеи / 코스모스 / 波斯菊 / 波斯菊</p>	
<p>The seed-bag flowers are: seed white (001), seed yellow (021), and seed red (200). There are three hybrid colours: pink, orange, and black. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for pink, orange; 240 for black.</p>
<h5 id="pinkcosmos">pink cosmos</h5>
<p>Pink cosmos can be obtained from a seed white plus a seed red.</p>
<blockquote>

<h5 id="orangecosmos">orange cosmos</h5>
<p>Orange cosmos can be obtained from a seed yellow plus a seed red.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 021, seed red 200</br>
offsprings: <strong>orange 110 (50&#37;)</strong>, <strong>orange 111 (50&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="blackcosmos">black cosmos</h5>
<p>Black cosmos can be obtained by breeding two orange cosmos. In the preceding step of mixing a seed yellow with a seed red, two types of orange cosmos are produced: orange 110 and orange 111. The spawn rate for black cosmos is very low for both orange 110 and orange 111 (see table below). Mass breeding orange cosmos is unavoidable. However, it is possible to 'improve' on the genes of the orange cosmos that are fed into the orange cosmos mass breeding field.</p> 
<p>In a mass-breeding field of orange cosmos, two orange 110s, or one orange 110 plus one orange 111, can produce orange offsprings 50&#37; of the time. Two orange 111s can produce orange offsprings 40.625&#37; (13/32) of the time. The orange offsprings can have various genotypes. There are seven possible orange cosmos genotypes, and two orange 111s are capable of having offsprings with any of the seven orange cosmos genotypes. There is a hierarchy amongst them for their spawn rate of black cosmos: 111 &lt; 110 &lt; 122 &lt; [121&#47;211] &lt; [120&#47;210], with 111 being the worst, and 210 being the best (with the exception that two 122s cannot spawn black cosmos). 122, 121, and 120 are relatively rare. The following are the probabilities of black offsprings when two orange cosmos breed with each other.</p>

	<p>Adding orange offsprings from an orange mass-breeding field directly back into the mass-breeding field will move the 'quality' of the genepool up and down uncontrollably. Having 'better' orange genotypes not only raises the spawn rate for black cosmos, it also improve the chances of having 'better' genotypes amongst its orange offsprings. Instead of just having a single field of orange cosmos mass-breeding uncontrollably, I have both a mass-breeding area, and a separate area where I try to increase the number of orange 211s and orange 210s, before I move them back into the mass-breeding area. I call this the 'gene funneling' area. From the first step of mixing a seed yellow with a seed red, the orange offsprings (you only need very few of these initial orange offsprings) are taken to a separate gene funneling area to breed with a seed red 200. I then wait for the orange cosmos to produce an orange offspring, before I move the orange parent to the mass-breeding area. The process is then repeated, with any orange offsprings in the gene-funneling area AND the mass-breeding area fed back to the gene-funneling area. The spawn rate of orange cosmos offsprings in the gene-funneling area is at least 50&#37;, and in the mass-breeding area at least 40.625&#37;.</p> 
	      <p>With orange 111, 110, 211, and 210, breeding one of them against a seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 50&#37; of the time. The resulting orange offspring will have the same genes as its orange parent, or have 'better' genes than its orange parent: 111 produces 111, 110, 211, or 210; 110 produces 110 or 210; 211 produces 211 or 210, 210 produces 210. (Each of them at equal probability within each set.) In other words, 50&#37; or 75&#37; of the time the orange offspring has 'better' genes than the orange parent, until an orange 210 is achieved.</p>
	      <p>With orange 122, 121, and 120, breeding it against a seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 100&#37; of the time. Half of them will have improved genes (211 or 210), while half of them will have less optimal genes (111 or 110). However, 122, 121 and 120 are relatively rare: they can only appear as new buds in the mass-breeding area and not the gene-funneling area (breeding orange cosmos with a seed red 200 does not produce 122/121/120), and having a larger number of initial orange 111s and orange 110s also keep the percentage of 122, 121, and 120s in the mass-breeding area relatively low. Even if 111s or 110s are produced by 122s/121s/120s, the new 111s or 110s can quickly produce better orange offsprings in the gene-funneling area.</p>
	      <p>As seen in the explanations above, the gene-funneling area leads to more and more orange 210 offsprings, and having more orange 210 offsprings in the mass-breeding area increases the chance of spawning black cosmos to 25&#37. The orange offsprings from two orange 210s are all orange 210s.</p>	      
<p>(To a degree, one could passively tell whether an orange cosmos has the 11x, 12x, or 21x genotype in the gene-funneling area: with a seed red 200, orange 11x produces pink (25&#37;), red (25&#37;), or orange (50&#37;) offsprings; orange 21x produces red (50&#37;) or orange (50&#37;) offsprings; 12x only produces orange offsprings. Beyond orange offsprings: while seeing pink offsprings is a prove that an orange cosmos is 11x, seeing red offsprings but no pink offsprings is NOT a prove that an orange cosmos is 21x; seeing red but no pink offsprings only strongly suggests that an orange cosmos is 21x.)</p>

<p>The seed-bag flowers are: seed white (001), seed yellow (020), and seed red (200). There are three hybrid colours: pink, purple, and green. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for pink, purple; 240 for green.</p>
<p>This is my method for obtaining green mums. During the process, pink and purple mums are also obtained at Step 2.</p> 
<p>Step 1 is mixing a seed yellow with a seed red.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 1</br>
		parents: seed yellow 020, seed red 200</br>
		offsprings: <strong>yellow 110 (100&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>		      
<p>Obviously, don't mix up the offspring yellow 110 with the parent seed yellow 020.</p> 
<p>Step 2 is mixing the resulting yellow 110 with another seed red.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 2</br>
		parents: yellow 110, seed red 200</br>
		offsprings: pink 100 (25&#37;), yellow 110 (25&#37;), seed red 200 (25&#37;), <strong>purple 210 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>    
	      <p>The red offsprings in this Step 2 and the following Step 3 are seed red 200s, which can be fed back into Steps 1 or 2 if needed.</p> 
<p>Step 3 is mixing two purple 210s.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 3</br>
		parents: purple 210, purple 210</br>
		offsprings: seed red 200 (25&#37;), purple 210 (50&#37;), <strong>green 220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>	           
	      <p>The purple offsprings in this Step 3 are the same as the parent purple 210, and they can be fed back into Step 3 to produce more purple 210s and green 220s (and seed red 200s for Steps 1 or 2). Two green 220s breeding with each other can only result in green 220s.</p>
	      <p>We have seen that pink 100s can spawn in Step 2 above. An alternative pathway for pink mums is mixing seed white 001 with seed red 200: the offsprings are pink 100 (50&#37;) or pink 101 (50&#37;). (Two pink 10x's breeding with each other produces pink mums 50&#37; of the time, all of which are 10x's.)</p>
	      <p>We have seen that purple 210s can spawn in Steps 2 and 3 above. An alternative pathway for purple mums is mixing two seed white 001s: the offsprings are white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), or purple 002 (25&#37;). Take note that this purple 002 from the white mum method cannot produce green mums when bred with each other, unlike the purple 210s from the green mum method. (The purple offsprings that can spawn from two pink 10x parents are also purple 002s.)</p>

<p>The following is my method for breeding purple pansies. During the process, blue pansies and orange pansies are also obtained.</p>
<p>Step 1 is mixing two seed whites.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 1</br>
		parents: seed white 001, seed white 001</br>
		offsprings: white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), <strong>blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>
<p>Step 2 is mixing the resulting blue 002 with a seed red.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 2</br>
		parents: blue 002, seed red 200</br>
		offsprings: <strong>red 101 (100&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>    
<p>Absolutely prevent the possibility of the seed red 200 self-replicating, lest it get mistaken with the intended hybrid red 101 offspring. Any excess hybrid red 101s can be used for mass-breeding somewhere else, with the spawn rate of purple 202s being 6.25&#37;. More hybrid red 101s will also spawn in the following Step 3, which can also be fed into this hybrid red 101 mass-breeding field.</p> 
<p>Step 3 is breeding the resulting red 101 with another blue 002 (from Step 1).</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 3</br>
parents: blue 002, red 101</br>
offsprings: seed white 001 (25&#37;), <strong>BAD blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong>, red 101 (25&#37;), <strong>GOOD blue 102 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
	      <p>There are two types of blue offsprings from Step 3: 'bad' blue 002 and 'good' blue 102. They look identical, but they can be tested by breeding with a seed yellow 020 in a separate area. With the 'bad' blue 002, the only possible offsprings are yellow 011; with the 'good' blue 102, half of the offsprings are yellow 011, and others are orange 111.</p> 
<blockquote>
	Test 3</br>
parents: blue 002 (bad), seed yellow 020</br>
offsprings: yellow 011 (100&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Test 3</br>
parents: blue 102 (good), seed yellow 020</br>
offsprings: yellow 011 (50&#37;), orange 111 (50&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>		      
<p>Any orange offsprings prove that the blue pansy is a 'good' blue 102. If none of the first four offsprings are orange, then the chance that this blue pansy is a 'good' 102 is too low, and should be removed from the breeding program. (Note that a lack of orange offsprings is NOT a prove that it is a 'bad' blue 002! So it is best not to feed this blue pansy back to Steps 2 or 3.) (If an offspring in Test 3 is blue, then your testing layout is suboptimal and the blue pansy has self-duplicated. Nonetheless, you can feed this duplicated blue pansy back into Test 3, and note VERY CAREFULLY which two blue pansy testees are equivalents.) Feed the 'good' blue 102s into the following Step 4, which involves mixing the 'good' blue 102s. (At least two 'good' blue 102s are needed; either have two 'good' blue 102s from Test 3, or have one 'good' blue 102 trasplanted somewhere else and have it self-replicate).</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 4</br>
parents: blue 102, blue 102</br>
offsprings: blue 002 (25&#37;), blue 102 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 202 (25&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
	<p>If needed, any blue offsprings from Step 4 can be fed back to Test 3 for more 'good' blue 102s, which can then be fed back into Step 4.</p>
	<p>A purple 202 breeding with another purple 202 can only result in purple 202s.</p>
	<p>Orange pansies can be obtained through Test 3 above (orange 111). There is another easier method for obtaining orange pansies: seed yellow 020 plus seed red 200 always result in orange 110s.</p>

<p>I knew this direct correspondence between pansies and windflowers too late, and ended up devising a more-complicated method for obtaining hybrid windflowers.

	      <p>You only need very few red offsprings from Step 1, as red 100s and red 101s will keep on turning up in the following Test 1a. (In Step 1,  make sure that there is no chance of the parent seed red 200 self-replicating.)</p>
	      <p>Next are two tests, Test 1a and Test 1b. In Test 1a, the red offsprings from Step 1 are tested against seed white 001s: 'bad' red 100s only produce red or white offsprings, whereas 'good' red 101s produce red, white, or blue offsprings.</p>

	      <p>Any red offsprings in Test 1a can be fed back into Test 1a. (Up until a point where you decide that... there are too many red windflowers. I stopped when I optained my first purple windflower.) If none of the first eight offsprings are blue, then the chance that a red windflower is a 'good' red 101 is too low, and it is best to remove that red windflower from the breeding program. Red windflowers that have produced any blue offsprings in Test 1a are 'good' red 101s, and can be kept in the testing ground for more blue offsprings.</p> 
	      <p>Blue offsprings from Test 1a progress to Test 1b. In Test 1b, the blue offsprings from Test 1a are tested against seed orange 020s: 'bad' blue 002s only produce orange offsprings, whereas 'good' blue 102s produce orange or pink offsprings.</p>

	<p>Purple 202 breading with another purple 202 will only result in purple 202s.</p>

	      <h5 id="orangeandpurplehyacinths">orange and purple hyacinths</h5>
<p>Step 1 is mixing a seed yellow 020 with a seed red 201.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 020, see red 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>orange 110 (50&#37;)</strong>, <strong>yellow 111 (50&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, make sure that the yellow 111 offsprings are not mistaken with the parent seed yellow 020.</p>
<p>Both orange 110 and yellow 111 can be used for mass-breeding of purple hyacinths, with all three combinations (110–110, 110–111, 111–111) having a spawn rate of purple offsprings at 6.25&#37; (1/16). Although orange 110 plus yellow 111 can also produce purple offsprings, it would be much easier to keep track of things if the orange and (non-seed) yellow hyacinths are placed in separate mass-breeding fields.</p>
	<p>In both the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields, any orange offsprings can be added to the orange mass-breeding field.</p>
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn orange 110 at 25&#37;, and orange 120 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn orange 110 at 6.25&#37;, and orange 120 at 3.125&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many of them have genes that will not lead to purple hyacinths.</p>	
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple hyacinths:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120s is to gene-funnel the orange hyacinths with seed yellow 020s: breed any orange offspring with a seed yellow in a separate gene-funneling area; move the orange hyacinth back to the mass-breeding field only after it has produced an orange offspring in the gene-funneling area, and repeat the process with any orange offsprings. Nonetheless, I would not recommend this, as the situation is different with the breeding of black cosmos (see above). With a mass-breeding field of orange cosmos, if the orange cosmos are left uncontrolled in a mass-breeding field, the genotypes of the orange cosmos can potentially 'worsen' in terms of spawn rate of black cosmos. With orange hyacinths, the genotypes of the orange hyacinths (110, 120) can only remain the same or improve in a mass-breeding field, and the rate that it improves in the mass-breeding field is not significantly lower than the rate that it improves with gene-funneling. It is probably not worth taking the orange hyacinths one or more days away from the mass-breeding field for gene-funneling. (Nonetheless, it is perhaps useful to know that this gene-funneling method exists if you are extremely unlucky with the purple-spawning situation in the orange mass-breeding field.)</p>
<p>Blue hyacinths can spawn in the orange mass-breeding field. Two orange 110s, or one orange 110 plus one orange 120, spawn blue hyacinths at a rate of 12.5&#37;. (On the other hand, two orange 120s cannot spawn blue hyacinths; this is another reason against artificially increasing the percentage of orange 120s by gene-funneling.) The Blue hyacinths that spawn in the <em>orange</em> mass-breeding field spawn purple 220s at a rate of 25&#37;:</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: blue 210, blue 210</br>
offsprings: red 200 (25&#37;), blue 210 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>Any blue hyacinth offspring from this step can be used for breeding more blue 210s and purple 220s.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, blue hyacinths that spawn in the <em>yellow</em> mass-breeding field can be either blue 210 or blue 002, and hence it is best not to use blue hyacinths from the yellow mass-breeding field, if the purpose is to breed purple hyacinths.)</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple hyacinths, purple hyacinths from two orange hyacinth parents are purple 210; purple hyacinths from one orange hyacinth and one yellow hyacinth 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple hyacinths from two yellow hyacinth 111 parents can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple hyacinths breeding with each other will only result in purple hyacinths.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: so far I have not tried this purple hyacinth method that I have devised, but I have tested the near-identical purple tulip method described below. When I first started with hyacinths, I had extreme luck and obtained purple and blue hyacinths from a very small number of random hyacinths very early on. Thereafter, the number of hyacinths grew uncontrollably. After devising this purple hyacinth method, I have ran out of space on my island to test this purple hyacinth method...)</p>
<h5 id="bluehyacinths">blue hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Blue hyacinths can be obtained through mass-breeding orange 110/120s or mass-breeding yellow 111s during the process of obtaining purple hyacinths (see above). An easier method for obtaining blue hyacinths is breeding two seed white 001s:<p> 
<blockquote>
	parents: seed white 001, seed white 001</br>
offsprings: white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), <strong>blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this blue 002 cannot spawn purple hyacinths when bred with each other, unlike the blue 210 which can be obtained from orange hyacinths (see above).</p>		      
<h5 id="pinkhyacinths">pink hyacinths</h5>
<p>Pink hyacinths can be obtained by mixing a seed white with a seed red.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed white 001, seed red 201</br>
offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, pink hyacinths can also appear in a mass-breeding field of yellow 111s (see above): two yellow 111s spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. An orange 110 mixing with a yellow 111 also spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;.</p> 
	<p>All pink hyacinths are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (37.5&#37; = 3/8), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (31.25&#37; = 5/16), blue 002 (6.25&#37; = 1/16).</p>

<h5 id="orangeandpurpletulips">orange and purple tulips</h5>

<p>Obviously, make sure that the yellow 111 offsprings are not mistaken with the parent seed yellow 020.</p>

<p>On the other hand, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many of them have genes that will not lead to purple tulips.</p>	
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple tulips:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120s is to gene-funnel the orange tulips with seed yellow 020s: breed any orange offspring with a seed yellow in a separate gene-funneling area; move the orange tulip back to the mass-breeding field only after it has produced an orange offspring in the gene-funneling area, and repeat the process with any orange offsprings.

(Nonetheless, it is perhaps useful to know that this gene-funneling method exists if you are extremely unlucky with the purple-spawning situation in the orange mass-breeding field.)</p>
<p>Black tulips can spawn in the mass-breeding fields. There are two types of black tulips, black 200 and black 210, with black 210 being the 'good' one in terms of breeding purple offsprings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn 'bad' black 200 at 6.25&#37;, and 'good' black 210 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn 'good' black 210 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>(orange 120 plus orange 120 does not spawn black tulips)</li>
	<li>yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn 'bad' black 200 at 1.5625&#37;, and 'good' black 210 at 3.125&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>Black tulips from the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields can be tested with seed white 001s. A 'bad' black 200 plus a seed white 001 only spawn red or pink offsprings, while a 'good' black 210 plus a seed white 001 spawn yellow, orange, red, or pink offsprings.</p>
<blockquote>
	Test</br>
	parents: seed white 001, black 200 (bad)</br>
offsprings: red 100 (50&#37;), pink 101 (50&#37;)</br>

<blockquote>
	Test</br>

offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), orange 110 (25&#37;), yellow 111 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
      <p>If none of the first four offsprings are yellow or orange, then the probability that the black tulip is black 210 is getting too low, and should be removed from the breeding program.</p>	
<p>Two 'good' black 210s spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: black 210, black 210</br>
offsprings: red 200 (25&#37;), blue 210 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>Any black tulip offsprings from two black 210s have to be retested with seed white 001s, and the 'good' black 210s can be used to produce more purple 220s.</p>	           
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple tulips, purple tulips from two orange tulip parents are purple 210; purple tulips from one orange tulip and one yellow tulip 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple tulips from two yellow tulip 111 parents can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple tulips breeding with each other will only result in purple tulips.</p>
<h5 id="blacktulips">black tulips</h5>

<p>However, this black 200 cannot spawn purple tulips when bred with each other, unlike the black 210s which can be obtained from some orange and yellow tulips (see the previous section first!)</p>		      
<h5 id="pinktulips">pink tulips</h5>
<p>Pink tulips can be obtained by mixing a seed white with a seed red.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, pink tulips can also appear in a mass-breeding field of yellow 111s (see above): two yellow 111s spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. An orange 110 mixing with a yellow 111 also spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. If you are testing black tulips (see above), black 200 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 50&#37;, while black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 25&#37;.</p> 
	<p>All pink tulips are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (31.25&#37; = 5/16), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (37.5&#37; = 3/8), black 200 (6.25&#37; = 1/16).</p>

<p>Unlike the other flowers, which have three allele pairs, roses have four allele pairs. Just one genotype out of the 81 rose genotypes is blue: blue 2220. (Gold roses involve a mechanism beyond the four allele pairs; see below.)</p>
<h5 id="pinkblackandgoldroses">pink, black, and gold roses</h5>

</blockquote>
<p>The mixing of two pink 1001/1011s can result in pink offsprings with various genotypes, with the offsprings of two pink 1011 roses being the most diverse. Two pink 1011 roses can produce offpsrings with the following pink genotypes: pink 1001, pink 1011, pink 1021, pink 2002, pink 2012, pink 2022. Mixing two pink 10x1 roses produces pink offsprings 31.25&#37; of the time. Mixing a pink 10x1 rose with a pink 20x2 rose produces pink offsprings 50&#37; of the time. Mixing two pink 20x2 roses produces pink offsprings 100&#37; of the time.</p>
<p>There is an alternative way of obtaining pink roses. When mixing two seed red roses, both pink and black offsprings can be obtained.</p>

<p>Gold roses involve a different mechanism from the usual flower genetics. The following information is based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_n5u-NxAQJ9dD5BocMgJtVigat2SZsZ-MI1faF8QysY/edit#gid=1293936192" target="_blank">yue's gold rose horror story</a> and Yue's <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/img/goldrose.png" target="_blank">Gold Roses Guide</a>.</p>
<p>A gold rose may spawn when two black roses breed with each other, or when a black rose self-replicate. The self-replicating black rose, or at least one in a pair of mutually breeding black roses, has to be watered by a golden water can, by a player standing directly in front of it while watering (i.e. standing in an orthogonally adjacent tile, with the player facing the black rose). A golden water can DIY recipe is given by Isabelle when an island reaches 5-star rating. (Alternatively, you can also have a golden watering can made/given/sold by another player.)</p> 
<p>(Despite a golden water can watering nine tiles,) only the black rose that is directly in front of the player while watering with a golden water can receives a 'gold flag' in the game code (coding that is beyond the usual four alleles). Having a gold flag in the code does not guarantee the spawning of a gold rose. However, the watering with a golden water can does not need to be repeated in order to maintain the gold flag, and the gold flag remains until a gold rose offspring spawns. The gold flag is maintained even if the black rose is dug up, or if the player time-travels backwards. (But backward time-travelling causes flowers to become unwatered, and watering is needed for breeding opportunity.)</p>
	<p>Another handy note is that, a golden water can, or any regular water can, does not wear if it waters on tiles that have already been watered on (by another watering can, or rained/snowed on).</p>
	<p>A gold rose does not self-replicate itself, or breed with another gold rose. However, a gold rose can breed with another non-gold rose. A gold rose has the genotype 0000.</p>
<p>(My experience with gold roses prior to reading Yue's work is that: I used to plant eight black roses in the outer tiles of a grid of nine, with no black rose in the middle. I watered those eight roses with a golden water can while standing in the N, S, E, or W tile. Yue's theory predicts that I would get no gold roses, but I still got gold roses sometimes, despite there being no black roses in the tile directly in front of me. However, it is possible that I might have occationally not been standing right on the N/S/E/W tile, and/or have faced slightly off-angled when watering. I don't have time to experiment on this further. Yue's method seems to have improved the number of gold roses that I get.)</p>
<h5 id="orangepurpleandblueroses">orange, purple, and blue roses</h5>
<p>There are many methods for blue roses, all of which have their pros and cons. Yue's <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/bluerose.html" target="_blank">Blue Rose Methods</a> page outlines five different methods. I followed the <em>Guaranteed blue rose path (v2)</em> in Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a> (v2 contains refinements of Paleh's v1 by jpony (jpony#3101 on discord)). The following is that method presented in my format. (Yue's blue rose page also contains <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/img/bluerose/paleh2_2.png" target="_blank">this useful diagram</a> of Paleh's method v2. However, what I call Step 3b, and what Paleh calls 3a, is not directly represented in Yue's diagram.)</p> 
<p>During the process, orange and purple roses are also obtained. The easiest way to obtain orange and purple roses is Step 1b for purple roses, and Step 1c for orange roses. They also appear again (with different genotypes) in a number of the following steps.</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 1a</br>
parents: seed white 0010, seed yellow 0200</br>
offsprings: yellow 0100 (50&#37;), <strong>white 0110 (50&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send white 0110 offsprings to Step 2</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Step 1b</br>
parents: seed white 0010, seed white 0010</br>
offsprings: white 0000 (25&#37;), seed white 0010 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 0020 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send purple 0020 offsprings to Step 2</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Step 1c</br>
parents: seed yellow 0200, seed red 2001</br>
offsprings: <strong>orange 1100 (50&#37;)</strong>, yellow 1101 (50&#37;)</br>
- Send orange 1100 offsprings to Step 4</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Step 2</br>
parents: purple 0020 (from Step 1b), white 0110 (from Step 1a)</br>
offsprings: seed white 0010 (25&#37;), <strong>BAD purple 0020 (25&#37;)</strong>, white 0110 (25&#37;), <strong>GOOD purple 0120 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send purple offsprings to Test 2</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Test 2</br>
parents: purple 0020 ('bad' purple from Step 2), seed yellow 0200</br>
offsprings: white 0110 (100&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Test 2</br>
parents: purple 0120 ('good' purple from Step 2), seed yellow 0200</br>
offsprings: white 0110 (50&#37;), <strong>yellow 0210 (50&#37;)</strong></br> 
- Send 'good' purple 0120 testees to Step 3a; send yellow 0210 offsprings to Steps 3b</br>
</blockquote>
<p>If the first four offsprings in test 2 are all white, then the probablity that the testee purple rose is a 'good' purple 0120 is too low, and should be removed from the breeding program. Absolutely prevent the tester seed yellow 0200 from self-replicating, as a 'good' purple 0120 can produce yellow ofsprings.</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 3a (Paleh's '3.')</br>
parents: purple 0120 (testee from Test 2), purple 0120 (testee from Test 2)</br>
offsprings: purple 0020 (25&#37;), purple 0120 (50&#37;), <strong>white 0220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send white 0220 offsprings to Step 4 and Step 5</br>
</blockquote>
<p>The purple offsprings can be fed back to Test 2 if needed.</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 3b (Paleh's '3a.')</br>
parents: yellow 0210 (offpsring from Test 2), yellow 0210 (offspring from Test 2)</br>
offsprings: seed yellow 0200 (25&#37;), yellow 0210 (50&#37;), <strong>white 0220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send white 0220 offsprings to Step 4 and Step 5</br>
</blockquote>
<p>I would just remove the yellow offsprings from the breeding program. Should you want to test whether the yellow offsprings in Step 3b are seed yellow 0200 or yellow 0210, I provide you with the following test: 'bad' seed yellow 0200 plus seed red 2001 equals orange 1100 or yellow 1101, while 'good' yellow 0210 plus seed red 2001 equals orange 1100, yelow 1101, red 1110, or pink 1111. While having any red or pink offsprings in this test confirms that the yellow testee is a 'good' yellow 0210, and can be fed back into Step 3b (but make sure that the tester seed red 2001 cannot self-replicate), the lack of red or pink offsprings cannot 100&#37; prove that the yellow testee is a 'bad' seed yellow 0200, so DON'T feed such yellow roses to, e.g., Step 1c.</p>
<p>In Steps 3a and 3b, keep the purple 0120s and yellow 0210s separate; DO NOT mix them.</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 4</br>
parents: white 0220 (from Step 3a or 3b), orange 1100 (from Step 1c)</br>
offsprings: white 0110 (25&#37;), yellow 0210 (25&#37;), red 1110 (25&#37;), <strong>orange 1210 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
- Send orange 1210 offsprings to Step 5</br>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't want to continue to Steps 5 and 6, or if you have excess orange 1210s, you can mass-breed orange 1210 in another area; mass-breeding orange 1210s spawns blue 2220 at a rate of 6.25&#37;. White 0110 offsprings from Step 4 can be fed back to Step 2 if needed.</p>
