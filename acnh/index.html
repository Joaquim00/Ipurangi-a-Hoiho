        <p>Greetings! The following are some of my experiences with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I haven't done much research on the existing knowledge published by other people. Some details that I provide below could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned; I have credited all data and methods that I learnt from other people, and any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. (I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable to any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.)</p>
        
<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
        <p>There are eight species of flowers in the game. (Excluding lily of the valley, which occationally spawns near cliff edges when an island has a 5-star rating at 05:00 AM, and weeds.) Three colours – most usually red, white, and yellow – of each species can be grown directly from seed bags. When the store is enlarged, three species of seeds are available: two are the native flowers of the island, and the remaining one depends on the seasonality at the island (i.e. which month, and whether the island is in northern or southern hemisphere). Leif sells some seeds that are not available at the shop. Otherwise you would have to rely on other people's islands for seeds that you can't get on your island.</p>
        <p>Beyond the basic three colours, there are three to six extra colours of a species ('hybrid flowers') that can result from a pair of flowers (of the same species) breeding with each other. A flower has a chance of breeding with another flower at the next turn of the day (05:00 AM or the first time the game is started thereafter) if it meets all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it is planted in the ground; ground here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path</li>
          <li>it is not planted on the beach (planting a flower on the beach is one way of keeping the flower but preventing it from breeding, and from growing)</li>
          <li>it has been watered by a player or villager, or it has been rained/snowed on</li>
          <li>it is adjacent to another flower of the same species orthogonally or diagonally (i.e. in the adjacent eight tiles), AND that this other flower has not bred with another flower at the next turn of the day</li>
          <li>these two flowers are in their flowering stage (fully matured flower stage) or budding stage (one day before a flower becomes a full flower), stages that you can already tell their colour. (If a flower is planted in the ground, it does not need water to advance towards the flowering stage; if it is planted on the beach, it retains the state that it was planted in)</li>
          <li>there is at least one tile that is empty ground in the surrounding tiles. For 'ground', see the definition above; by 'empty', nothing can be placed on that tile, or dropped on that tile (not even a fallen tree branch), or burried in that tile. A new offspring bud might spawn in that tile the next day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there is no flower of the same species in the surrounding tiles, or if all the flowers of the same species in the surrounding tiles have already bred with other flowers at the next turn of the day, and the other conditions above are fulfilled, then there is a chance that that flower self-replicates the next day, resulting in a new bud with the same genes.</p> 
        <p>The probability of flower spawning increases with each day of that flower being watered, up until [I can remember how many days], and the probability is reset by the flower being dug up. The probability is also raised by watering by visitors from other islands, up to five visitors.</p>     
        <p>(Unless a flower self-replicates,) the inheritance of genes from two parents basically follows Mendelian inheritance. All flowers have three active allele pairs (three out of four possible types), except for roses which have four active allele pairs. The four possible types are labled Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss by Paleh. The allele pairs are coded binarily in the game as 00, 01, or 11. The child receives one random allele from each allele pair from each of the parents. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allel pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive, except for Ww where 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive. In parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code or 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 for binary 00 (usually recessive–recessive)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 for binary 01 (dominant–recessive)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 for binary 11 (usually dominant–dominant)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the genetic make up for the flowers. Roses are described by a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220. Other flowers are described by a string of three ternary numbers for their three allel pairs.</p>        
        <p>Flowers of the same species and colour planted directly from seed bags have the same genetic make up. They are the safest starting point for breeding programs. As for the native flowers at the beginning of an island, they also have the same genetic make up as the seed flowers. However, unless you manage to dig them up on the first day, it is possible that new flowers have already spawn the next day; they can have the same colour as their parent, but they could have different genes, and by the third day they are already fully grown. Hence treat the flowers already grown on the island with caution, especially the flowers in the upper two levels, as it take some days at the beginning of the game before one could reach the upper levels.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the basic-colour flowers encountered in the mystery island tours have the same genetic make up as the seed bags, and are hence safe to use. (When the game was published in March 2020, there were some mysetery islands with hybrid-colour flowers, but the hybrid-flower islands have since been removed from the game.)</p>
        <p>The following outlines the breeding programs that I have used to obtain the hybrid flowers. Some hybrid colours have relatively low chances of spawning. There are two types of approaches, at two ends of a spectrum, on how to increase the chance of getting such rare hybirds:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mass-breeding: having a big quantity of flowers of the parent colours, in the hope that one rare hybrid flower might spawn</li>
          <li>selective-breeding: having complicated breeding programs, increasing the chance of getting a rare hybrid flower with each generation</li>
        </ul>
<p>Mass-breeding-type programs sometimes involve a small number of steps. Selective-breeding-type programs would also benefit from having more participants in each generation, especially with the first generation. I prefer the selective-breeding apprach; I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least twenty-five percent. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increase the chance of error.) There are multiple methods for the same goal. Within each of the two types of approaches, it is possible to evaluate which method is more optimal. However, between the two types of approaches, it would be difficult to tell which type of approach would create the desired hybrid flower quicker. With the low probability in a mass-breeding-type program, a desired hybrid flower can spawn anytime from the next day if one is extremely lucky to 'never' if one is extremely unlucky. In some cases it is possible/feasible/desirable to use both approaches concurrently to increase one's chances.</p>
