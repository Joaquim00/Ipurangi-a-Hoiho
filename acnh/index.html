        <p>Greetings! The following are some of my experiences with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I haven't done much research on the guides and tips published by other people. Some details that I provide below could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned; I have credited all data and methods that I learnt from other people, and any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. (I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable for any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.)</p>
        
<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
        <p>There are eight species of flowers in the game. (Excluding lily of the valley, which occationally spawns near cliff edges when an island has a 5-star rating at 05:00 AM, and weeds.) Three colours – most usually red, white, and yellow – of each species can be grown directly from seed bags. The upgraded store on an island sells three species of seeds: two are of the native flowers of the island (often called the 'native flower' and the 'sister flower'), and the remaining one depends on the seasonality at the island (i.e. which month, and whether the island is in the northern or southern hemisphere). Leif sells some seeds that are not available at the shop. Otherwise you would have to rely on other people's islands for seeds that you can't get on your island.</p>
        <p>Beyond the basic three colours, there are three to six extra colours of a species ('hybrid flowers') that can result from a pair of flowers of the same species breeding with each other. A flower has a chance of breeding with another flower at the next turn of the day (05:00 AM, or the first time the game is started thereafter) if it meets all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it is planted in the ground; ground here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path</li>
          <li>it is not planted on the beach (planting a flower on the beach is one way of keeping the flower but preventing it from breeding, and from growing)</li>
          <li>it has been watered by a player or an animal villager, or it has been rained/snowed on</li>
          <li>it is adjacent to another flower of the same species orthogonally or diagonally (i.e. in the adjacent eight tiles), AND that this other flower has not bred with another flower at the next turn of the day</li>
          <li>these two flowers are in their flowering stage (fully matured flower stage) or budding stage (one day before a flower becomes a full flower), stages that you can already tell their colours. (If a flower is planted in the ground, it does not need water to grow towards the flowering stage; if it is planted on the beach, it retains the state that it was planted in and does not grow)</li>
          <li>there is at least one tile that is empty ground in the surrounding tiles. For 'ground', see the definition above; by 'empty', nothing can be placed or dropped on that tile, have fallen on that tile, or burried in that tile. A tile that is half or entirely on a different level (cliff, water, beach) does not count</li>
        </ul>
	      <p>If all the conditions are satisfied, there is a chance that two flowers of the same species would breed with each other, resulting in a bud spawing in a neighbouring empty ground tile.</p>
	      <p>If there is no flower of the same species in the surrounding tiles (on the same level), or if all the flowers of the same species in the surrounding tiles (on the same level) have already bred with other flowers at the next turn of the day, but the other conditions above are fulfilled, then there is a chance that that flower self-replicates the next day, resulting in a new bud with the same genes.</p>
        <p>Flowers of the same species and colour planted directly from seed bags have the same genetic make up. They are the safest starting point for breeding programs. As for the native flowers at the beginning of an island, they also have the same genetic make up as the seed flowers. However, unless you manage to dig them up on the first day, it is possible that new buds have already spawn the next day; they can have the same colour as their parent(s), but their genes can be different. Add one more day and they are already fully grown. Hence treat the existing flowers at the beginning of an island with caution, especially the flowers in the upper two levels, as it take some days at the beginning of the game before one can reach the upper levels.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the basic-colour flowers encountered in the mystery island tours (the small islands reached by using a Nook Mile Ticket at the airport) have the same genetic make up as the seed bag seeds, and are hence safe substitute for seed flowers in breeding programs. (When the game was published in March 2020, there were some mystery islands with hybrid-colour flowers, but the hybrid-flower islands have since been removed from the game.) Remember to transplant the plant with a spade; flowers picked by hand will not grow again!</p>
        <p>The following outlines the breeding programs that I used to breed hybrid flowers. Some hybrid flowers have very low chances of spawning. There are two types of approaches on how to increase the chance of getting such rare hybrids:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mass-breeding: having a large quantity of 'low probability parents', in the hope that one rare hybrid might spawn</li>
          <li>selective-breeding: having step-wise breeding programs (often complicated), increasing the chance of getting a rare hybrid with each generation</li>
        </ul>
<p>Elements of them are not mutually exclusive; mass-breeding-type programs sometimes involve a small number of steps. Selective-breeding-type programs  also benefit from having more participants in each step. I prefer the selective-breeding apprach; I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least twenty-five percent. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increases the chance of error.) There are multiple methods for the reaching same goal. Within each of the two types of approaches, it is possible to evaluate which method is more optimal. However, between the two types of approaches, it is perhaps imposible to tell which type of approach creates the desired hybrid faster. With the low probability in a mass-breeding-type program, a desired hybrid flower can spawn anytime from the next day if one is extremely lucky to 'never' if one is extremely unlucky. In some cases it is possible/feasible/desirable to use both approaches concurrently to increase one's chances.</p>
	<p>Before we move on, we have to talk a little bit about the genetics of the flowers in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I benifited greatly from Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#heading=h.8ezjcm1008jf" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a>, which was updated with the complete flower genetics datamined by Aeter, outlined in Aeter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/edit#gid=528655130" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Research</a>. See both documents and links therein. (To be honest, I haven't dug very deep...) I suggest looking through these two resources, and also the links therein. Also very useful is the <a href="https://gardenscience.ac/" traget="_blank">Flower Breeding Simulator</a> by AeonSake. With the breeding methods below, some of them I simply followed Paleh's methods; others I have devised myself, calculated from the complete gene tables.</p>		
		<p>(Unless a flower self-replicates,) the inheritance of genes from two parents basically follows Mendelian inheritance. All flowers have three active allele pairs (three out of four possible types), except for roses which have four active allele pairs. The four possible types are labled Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss by Paleh. The allele pairs are coded binarily in the game as 00, 01, or 11. The child receives one random allele from each allele pair from each parent. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allele pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive, except for Ww where 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive. In parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code of 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 for binary 00 (recessive–recessive rr, yy, ss, and dominant–dominant WW)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 for binary 01 (dominant–recessive Rr, Yy, Ww, Ss)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 for binary 11 (dominant–dominant RR, YY, SS, and recessive–recessive ww)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the genetic make up of the flowers. Roses are described by a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220, in other words binary 11 11 11 00, or Paleh's RR YY ww ss. Other flowers are described by a string of three ternary numbers for their three active allele pairs.</p>
	      <p>The results of two allele pairs combining can be:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>0 and 0: 0 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>0 and 2: 1 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>2 and 2: 2 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>1 and 0: 1 or 0 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 2: 1 or 2 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 1: 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 (25&#37; each)</li>
	      </ul>
<p>As can be inferred, having two roses 1111 (pink) breeding with each other is the most chaotic, with all 81 gene combinations (3 to the power of 4) being possible outcomes. Exactly one of them is the blue rose 2220, at a probability of 1/(4*4*4*4) (&asymp;0.39&#37;).</p>

	      <p>Black cosmos can be obtained by breeding two orange cosmos. In the preceeding section, a seed yellow and a seed red are used to breed orange 110 or orange 111 (5050&#37 each). However, the spawn rate for black cosmos is very low for orange 110 and orange 111, with orange 111 being the worst out of all the orange cosmos genotypes (with one rare exception). There is a hierarchy of the seven possible orange cosmos genotypes in terms of their spawn rate of black cosmos when breeding with other orange cosmos: 111 &lt; 110 &lt; 122 &lt; [121~211] &lt; [120~210], with 111 being the worst, and 210 being the best (with the exception that two 122s cannot spawn black cosmos; also, 122, 121, and 120 are rare). The following table outlines the probability that a spawning bud is black when two orange cosmos breed with each other.</p>

	<p>Instead of simply having a large field of orange 111s and 110s, I have both a mass breeding area and a separate selective breeding area, which usually produces orange cosmos with better genes. In the selective breeding area, I breed any orange buds that spawn in either breeding area with a seed red cosmos 200. I wait till that orange cosmos produce another orange offspring (with the seed red cosmos) before I move the original orange cosmos to the mass breeding area. The spawn rate of orange cosmos offsprings in the selective breeding area is at least 50&#37;, and in the mass breeding area at least 40.625&#37;.</p> 
	      <p>With orange 111, 110, 211, and 210, breeding one of them against a seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 50&#37; of the time. The resulting orange offspring will either have the same genes as the original orange cosmos or have better genes: 111 produces 111, 110, 211, or 210 (25&#37; each out of the orange offsprings); 110 produces 110 or 210 (50&#37; each out of the orange offsprings); 211 produces 211 or 210 (50&#37; each out of the orange offsprings), 210 produces 210.</p>
	      <p>With orange 122, 121, and 120, breeding it against seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 100% of the time. Half of them will have improved genes (211 or 210), while half of them will have less optimal genes (111 or 110). However, 122, 121 and 120 are relatively rare: they can only appear as new buds in the mass breeding area and not the selective breeding area (breeding orange cosmos with a seed red 200 does not produce 122/121/120), and a larger number of flowers participating in the initial selective breeding area could keep the number of 122, 121, and 120 in the mass breeding area relatively low. Even if 111s or 110s were produced, the new 111s or 110s can usually produce new orange offsprings with better genes in the selective breeding area.</p>
	      <p>The following are the possible offsprings of the seven types of orange cosmos when bred with seed red 200 (their probabilities are the same within each row):</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>orange 111: orange 111, orange 110, orange 211, orange 210, pink 100, pink 101, red 200, red 201</li>
		      <li>orange 110: orange 110, orange 210, pink 100, red 200</li>
		      <li>orange 122: orange 111, orange 211</li>
		      <li>orange 121: orange 111, orange 110, orange 211, orange 210</li>
		      <li>orange 120: orange 110, orange 210</li>
		      <li>orange 211: orange 211, orange 210, red 200, red 201</li>
		      <li>orange 210: orange 210, red 200</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>As seen in the explanations above, the selective breeding area leads to more and more orange 210 offsprings, and having more orange 210 offsprings in the mass breeding area increases the chance of spawning black cosmos to 25&#37.</p>

	      <p>Secondly, in this step 3, there are two types of blue offsprings: the 'bad' blue 002, and the 'good' blue 102. They can be tested with a seed yellow 020: with the 'bad' blue 002, the only possible offsprings are yellow 011; with the 'good' blue 102, half of the offsprings are yellow 011, and others are orange 111. When a blue pansy from step 3 breeds with a seed yellow 020, if the there are four yellow offsprings in a row, then the chances that it is a 'good' blue 102 is too low, and can be removed from the breeding program. (You can't be absolutely sure that it is a blue 002 either, so best not to feed this blue pansy back to step 3.) A single orange offspring can confirm that the blue pansy is a 'good' blue 102 pansy. (If the offspring is blue, then the blue pansy has self-duplicated.)</p>

I knew about this direct correspondence between pansies and windflowers very late, after I have already obtained purple windflowers using another method that I have devised, which is more complicated, requiring massive testing fields.

<p>Both orange 110 and yellow 111 can be used to mass-breed purple hyacinths, with all three combinations (110–110, 110–111, 111–111) having a spawn rate of purple offsprings at 1/16 = 6.25&#37;. You may want to have separate mass-breeding fields of orange and yellow hyacinths (but make sure that it is a yellow 111 that is added to the mass-breeding field, and not a self-duplicated seed yellow 020). With both the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields, any orange offsprings can be added to the orange mass-breeding field: orange 110 plus orange 110 spawns orange 110 at 25&#37;, and orange 120 at 12.5&#37;; yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawns orange 110 at 6.25&#37;, and orange 120 at 3.125&#37;. However, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow  mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many will not lead to purple hyacinths.</p>
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple hyacinths: orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;; orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;; orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120 is to separate out any orange buds from the orange or yellow mass-breeding fields, have it breed with a seed yellow 020, and move it back to the orange mass-breeding field after it has produced one orange offspring. Feed this orange offspring back into breeding with a seed yellow 020 and repeat the process. A orange 110 plus a seed yellow 020 spawn orange 110 at 25&#37;, orange 120 at 25&#37;, (yellow 010 at 25&#37;, yellow 020 at 25&#37;). While this process increases the chance of spawning purple hyacinths in the orange mass-breeding field, it is doubtful that this speeeds up the process of spawning purple hyacinths. And if blue hyacinths are desired, two orange 120s breeding with each other do not result in blue hyacinths.</p>
	      <p>In the orange mass-breeding field, orange 110–orange 110 and orange 110–orange 120 spawn blue 210 at 12.5&#37;. Two blue 210s breeding with each other spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;, the same blue 210 at 5025&#37;(, and red 200 at 25&#37;). (On the other hand, orange 120–orange 120 do not spawn blue hyacinths. Blue hyacinths spawn in the yellow mass-breeding field can be either blue 210 or blue 002, and hence it is best not to use blue hyacinths from the yellow mass-breeding field.)</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple hyacinths, purple hyacinths from two orange hyacinths are purple 210; purple hyacinths from one orange hyacinth and one yellow hyacinth (111 or 121) can be purple 210 or 211; purple hyacinths from two yellow hyacinths (111 or 121) can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple hyacinths breeding with each other will only result in purple hyacinths.</p>
	      <h5>blue hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Blue hyacinths can be obtained during the process of obtaining purple hyacinths (see the previous section). An easier way of obtaining blue hyacinths is breeding two seed white 001s: the offsprings are white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), blue 002 (25&#37;). However, this blue 002 will not spawn purple hyacinths when bred with each other, unlike the blue 210 which can be obtained from two orange 110 (see previous section).</p>
	      <h5>pink hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Seed white 001 plus seed red 201 results in the following offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;). Pink tulips can also appear in the yellow mass-breeding field (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn 101 at 6.25&#37;.</p> 
		<p>All pink hyacinths are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (37.5&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (31.25&#37;), blue 002 (6.25&#37;).</p>

While this process increases the chance of spawning purple tulips in the orange mass-breeding field, it is doubtful that this speeeds up the process of spawning purple tulips. And if black tulips are desired, two orange 120s breeding with each other do not result in black tulips.</p>
	      <p>In the orange mass-breeding field, orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn black tulips at 18.75&#37;, consisting of black 200 (6.25&#37;) and black 210 (12.5&#37;). Orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn only black 210 (12.5&#37;). (Orange 120 plus orange 120 does not spawn black tulips.) In the yellow mass-breeding field (all of them have to be yellow 111), black 200 spawn at 1.5625&#37;, and black 210 spawn at 3.125&#37;. Black 210 is the good one, and these two types of black tulips can be tested with a seed white 001. Black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn yellow, orange, red, or pink offsprings, while black 200 plus seed white 001 only spawn red or pink offsprings</p> 
	      <p>Test: </p>
	      <p>If none of the first four offsprings are yellow or orange, then the probability that the black tulip is black 210 is getting too low, and can be removed from the breeding program.</p>		      
	      <p>In addition to waiting for a purple tulip to spawn in the orange and yellow mass breeding fields, if you can get hold of black 210s, two black 210s spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>	      
	      <p>Step</p>		      
	      <p>The black offsprings can be fed back into the black-plus-seed-white tulip test described above.</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple tulips, purple tulips from two orange tulips are purple 210; purple tulips from one orange  and one yellow tulip 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple tulips from two yellow tulips 111 can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple tulips breeding with each other only result in purple tulips.</p>
	      <h5>black tulips</h5>
	      <p>Black tulips can be obtained during the process of obtaining purple tulips (see the previous section).

However, this black 200 will not spawn purple tulips when bred with each other, unlike the black 210 which can be obtained from orange or yellow tulips (see previous section).</p>
	      <h5>pink tulips</h5>
	      <p>Seed white 001 plus seed red 201 results in the following offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;). Pink tulips can also appear in the yellow mass-breeding field (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn 101 at 6.25&#37;. If you are testing black tulips (see above), black 200 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 50&#37;, while black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 25&#37;.</p> 
		<p>All pink tulips are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (31.25&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (37.5&#37;), black 200 (6.25&#37;).</p>
