        <p>Greetings! The following are some of my experiences playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some details that I provide below could well be identical to what other people have already mentioned (honestly I haven't done much research on similar guides published by other people); I have credited all data and methods that I learnt from other people, while any uncredited methods and speculations here are my own. I strive to be as accurate as possible, but I cannot be held accountable for any inaccuracies, or any errors on your part.</p>
        
<h3 id="flowers">
<a id="flowers" class="anchor" href="#flowers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flowers</h3>
        <p>Seeds of eight species of flowers exist in the game. Each comes in three colours; except for windflowers, of which the 'seed colours' are white, orange, and red, the seed colours for the other seven species are white, yellow, and red. Beyond the three basic seed colours, two flowers of the same species can breed and create hybrid flowers of three to six other colours, depending on the species. This section outlines my methods for breeding these hybrid colours for each species.</p>
	      <h4 id="preliminaries">
<a id="preliminaries" class="anchor" href="#preliminaries" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminaries</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the game, two species of flowers exist on the island; one is found on the ground level, and another is found on the not-immediately-reachable upper 'cliff' levels. I call these the 'native flowers'. Many people call one the 'native flower' and the other the 'sister flower'.</p>
<p>The primary ways of obtaining seeds is from the tent/shop, and from Leif. At the tent stage, three types of seeds are available. At the small shop stage, six types of seeds are available: two colours of three species. At the large shop stage, nine types of seeds are available: three colours of three species. At the large shop stage, two of the species are the native flowers of the island, and the remaining species is another species in season. Leif is a trader that comes one day per week during Monday to Friday, after residence service has been upgraded. (Update 1.2.0 / 23 April 2020 of the game is required.) He sells some seeds of flower species that are not sold at the shop. Otherwise you have to rely on other players for seeds that they have or are sold on their island.</p>
        <p>A flower has a chance of breeding with another flower at the next turn of the day (05:00 AM) if it meets all the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the flower is planted in the ground; ground here includes grass, dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path</li>
          <li>the flower has been watered by a player or an animal villager, or it has been rained/snowed on (a flower becomes unwatered again after potential breeding at the next turn of the day, or time travelling to an earlier time)</li>
          <li>the flower is adjacent to another flower of the same species orthogonally or diagonally (i.e. in the adjacent eight tiles), AND that this other flower has not bred with another flower at the next turn of the day</li>
          <li>these two flowers are in their bud stage or full flower stage. (When planted from a seed bag, on the first day a flower is a sprout, the second day a stem, the third day a bud, and the fourth day a fully grown flower. At the bud and full flower stages its colour is visible. If the flower is planted in the ground, it does not need water to grow towards the flowering stage. A new flower that spawns from other flowers starts as a bud)</li>
          <li>with the tiles adjacent to the flowers, at least one of them is an empty ground tile. For 'ground', see the definition above; by 'empty', nothing can be placed or dropped on that tile, have fallen on that tile, or burried in that tile. An adjacent tile that is partially or entirely on a different level (cliff, water, beach) also does not qualify</li>
        </ul>
	   <p>If all the conditions are satisfied, then there is a chance that the two flowers breed with each other, with an offspring budding in an adjacent empty ground tile.</p>
	      <p>If there is no flower of the same species in the adjacent tiles (on the same level), or if all the flowers of the same species in the adjacent tiles (on the same level) have already bred with other flowers, and all the other conditions are satisfied, then there is a chance that that flower self-replicates as a bud in an adjacent tile at the turn of the day.</p>   
	      <p>Having players from other islands watering a flower increases the probability that that flower breeds with other flowers (or self-replicate) at the next turn of the day. The probability does not rise further when watering is done by more than five players from other islands.</p>     
	      <p>Plants that are planted in the beach area do not grow or breed. Planting a flower in the beach area is one way of keeping the flower but preventing it from breeding.</p>     
	      <p>Flowers of the same colour and species grown from seed bags have the same genetic make up. This make seed bags the safest starting point for breeding programs. As for the native flowers at the beginning of an island in the game, they also have the same genetic make up as the seed-bag flowers. However, unless you manage to dig them up on the first day, it is possible that new buds could have already spawn the next day; some have the same colour as their parent(s), but their genotypes can be different. Add one more day and the newly spawn flowers are already fully grown flowers, making it often impossible to tell whether a basic-colour flower on the island has the same genes as seed-bag flowers or not by the third day. The existing flowers on a player's island are hence usually unreliable for breeding programs. This is especially the case with the flowers on the upper two levels, as normally it take some days at the beginning of the game before a player can reach the upper levels.</p>
        <p>On a mystery-tour island (small island reached by using a Nook Mile Ticket at the airport), one can encounter one of the two native flower species, in their basic colours. These flowers have the same genetic make up as the seed-bag flowers, and are hence safe use for breeding programs. Remember to transplate the flower with a spade! Flowers picked by hand cannot grow again! (Between the roll-out of the game on 23 March 2020 and update 1.2.0 on 23 April 2020, some mystery-tour islands had hybrid-colour flowers on them. These hybrid islands have since been removed.)</p>
        <p>The following outlines the breeding programs that I used for breeding hybrid flowers. Some hybrid flowers have very low probability of spawning from seed-bag flowers or early-generation hybrids. There are two types of approach for increasing the chance of such hybrids spawning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>mass-breeding: having a large pool of low-probability parents breeding with each other, hoping that one rare hybrid would eventually spawn</li>
          <li>selective-breeding: having step-wise breeding programs (often complicated), improving the spawn rate of rare hybrids with each generation</li>
        </ul>
<p>Elements of these two types of approach are not mutually exclusive; mass-breeding-type programs often involve a small number of steps, and selective-breeding-type programs also benefit from having more participants in each step. I prefer the selective-breeding apprach; I like to increase the chance of getting hybrid flowers to ideally at least twenty-five percent. (However, having complicated breeding programs also increases the chance of error; a high level of caution is needed at each step.)</p> 
	   <p>There are often multiple methods for reaching the same goal. Within each of the two types of approach, it is often possible to evaluate which one out of two methods is more optimal. On the other hand, it is perhaps imposible to evaluate across the two types of approach. A selective-breeding-type approach is more controlled (if done correctly); the range of time that it takes between the start of the breeding program and the spawning of a rare hybrid is conceptually easier to model. A mass-breeding-type approach has a low spawning rate of such rare hybrids; with less control over the spawning rate of such rare hybrids, one could be extremely lucky and have a rare hybrid spawn the next day with just two low-probability parents, or one could be extremely lucky and 'never' encounter a rare hybrid with the low-probability parents. In some cases it is feasible/desirable to use both approaches concurrently to increase one's chances.</p>
	<p>Before we move on, we have to talk a little bit about the genetics of the flowers in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I benifited greatly from Paleh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/preview#heading=h.8ezjcm1008jf" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Genetics Guide</a>, which was updated with the complete flower genetics datamined by Aeter, outlined in Aeter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/edit#gid=528655130" target="_blank">ACNH Flower Research</a>. I suggest looking through these two resources, and also the links therein. (To be honest, I haven't dug very deep...) Also very useful is the <a href="https://gardenscience.ac/" traget="_blank">Flower Breeding Simulator</a> by AeonSake. With the breeding methods below, some of them I simply followed Paleh's methods; others I have devised myself, calculated from the complete gene tables.</p>		
		<p>(Unless a flower self-replicates,) gene inheritance of the flowers basically follows Mendelian inheritance. All flowers have three active allele pairs, except for roses which have four allele pairs. Paleh labels the alleles Rr, Yy, Ww, and Ss. (The three-allele-pair flowers have either RYW or RYS.) Aeter lables the alleles R, Y, W, and roses have an extra B. (Or alternatively, G1, G2, G3, G4 respectively.) The allele pairs are coded in the game as binary 00, 01, or 11. The offspring receives one random allele from each allele pair from each parent. (If a 1 and a 0 is passed on, the resulting allele pair is recorded as 01, never 10.) Using Paleh's nomenclature, 1 is dominant and 0 is recessive for Rr, YY, and Ss, while 0 is dominant and 1 is recessive for Ww. In parts of the game code, the allele pairs are additionally given a ternary code of 0, 1, or 2:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>ternary 0 = binary 00 (recessive–recessive rr, yy, ss, and dominant–dominant WW)</li>
          <li>ternary 1 = binary 01 (dominant–recessive Rr, Yy, Ww, Ss)</li>
          <li>ternary 2 = binary 11 (dominant–dominant RR, YY, SS, and recessive–recessive ww)</li>
        </ul>
<p>This ternary code is used extensively as a short-hand for the flower genotypes. Roses are described using a string of four ternary numbers for their four allele pairs, e.g. all blue roses are 2220, in other words binary 11 11 11 00, or Paleh's RR YY ww ss. Other flowers are described using a string of three ternary numbers for their three active allele pairs.</p>
	      <p>When allele pairs from two parents combine, the offspring allele pair is:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>0 and 0: 0 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>0 and 2: 1 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>2 and 2: 2 (100&#37;)</li>
		      <li>1 and 0: 1 or 0 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 2: 1 or 2 (50&#37; each)</li>
		      <li>1 and 1: 0 or 1 or 1 or 2 (25&#37; each)</li>
	      </ul>
<p>As can be inferred, having two pink roses 1111 breeding with each other is the most chaotic scenario possible, with all 81 gene combinations (3*3*3*3) being possible outcomes. Exactly one of them is the blue rose 2220, at a probability of 1/(4*4*4*4) = 0.390625&#37;.</p>

	      <p>Lilies are the easiest. The seed-bag flowers are: seed white 002, seed yellow 020, and seed red 201. There are three hybrid colours: orange, black, and pink. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for orange, black, pink.</p>

	</blockquote>
<p>Any red offsprings of two seed red 201s are also seed red 201, and can be used again for this method. Two black 200s breeding with each other can only result in black 200s, and two pink 202 breeding with each other can only result in pink 202s.</p>
<p>An alternative method for obtaining pink lelies is mixing seed white and seed red parents.</p>
	  <blockquote>
	  parents: seed white 002, seed red 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (50&#37;)</br>
	 </blockquote>
<p>Two pink 101s breeding with each other produces red (25&#37;), pink (31.25&#37;), white (37.5&#37;), or black 200 (6.25&#37;).</p>

<p>Black cosmos can be obtained by breeding two orange cosmos from the preceding steps. In the preceding step, two types of orange cosmos were produced: orange 110 and orange 111. The spawn rate for black cosmos is very low for both orange 110 and orange 111. Two orange 110s, or one orange 110 plus one orange 111, produce orange offsprings 5050&#37; of the time, while two orange 111s produce orange offsprings 40.62550&#37; (13/32) of the time, all with various genotypes. There are seven possible orange cosmos genotypes, and there is a hierarchy amongst them in terms of their spawn rate of black cosmos: 111 &lt; 110 &lt; 122 &lt; [121&#47;211] &lt; [120&#47;210], with 111 being the worst, and 210 being the best (with the exception that two 122s cannot spawn black cosmos). 122, 121, and 120 are relatively rare. The following are the probabilities of black offsprings when two orange cosmos breed with each other.</p>

	<p>Instead of just having a single field of orange cosmos mass-breeding uncontrollably, I have both a mass-breeding area and a separate selective-breeding area. The aim of the selective-breeding area is to increase the number of 'better' orange cosmos, before moving them into the mass-breeding area. (While I don't actively try to determine the exact genotype of the orange cosmos in the selective-breeding area, theoratically 'better' orange cosmos are produced there at least half of the time.) In the selective breeding area, I breed any orange buds that spawn in either the mass-breeding area or the selective-breeding area with a seed red cosmos 200. I wait till that orange cosmos produces another orange offspring (with the seed red cosmos) before I move the original orange cosmos to the mass breeding area. The process is then repeated. The spawn rate of orange cosmos offsprings in the selective breeding area is at least 50&#37;, and in the mass breeding area at least 40.625&#37;.</p> 
	      <p>With orange 111, 110, 211, and 210, breeding one of them against a seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 50&#37; of the time. The resulting orange offspring will either have the same genes as its orange parent, or have better genes: 111 produces 111, 110, 211, or 210 (equal probability); 110 produces 110 or 210 (equal probability); 211 produces 211 or 210 (equal probability), 210 produces 210.</p>
	      <p>With orange 122, 121, and 120, breeding it against seed red 200 produces an orange offspring 100% of the time. Half of them will have improved genes (211 or 210), while half of them will have less optimal genes (111 or 110). However, 122, 121 and 120 are relatively rare: they can only appear as new buds in the mass-breeding area and not the selective-breeding area (breeding orange cosmos with a seed red 200 does not produce 122&#47;121&#47;120), and having a larger number of initial orange 111s and orange 110s also keep the number of 122, 121, and 120s in the mass-breeding area relatively low. Even if 111s or 110s were produced by 122s&#47;121s&#47;120s, the new 111s or 110s can quickly produce better orange offsprings in the selective-breeding area.</p>
	      <p>One could passively tell whether an orange cosmos has the genotype 11x, 12x, or 21x in the selective-breeding area: with a seed red 200, 11x produces pink offsprings (25&#37;), red offsprings (25&#37;), or orange offsprings (50&#37;); 21x produces red offsprings (50&#37;) or orange offsprings (50&#37;); 12x only produces orange offsprings.
	      <p>As seen in the explanations above, the selective-breeding area leads to more and more orange 210 offsprings, and having more orange 210 offsprings in the mass-breeding area increases the chance of spawning black cosmos to 25&#37.</p>

<p>The seed-bag flowers are: seed white 001, seed yellow 020, and seed red 200. There are three hybrid colours: pink, purple, and green. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for pink, purple; 240 for green.</p>
<p>This is my method for obtaining green mums. During the process, pink and purple mums are also obtained.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 1</br>
		parents: seed yellow 020, seed red 200</br>
		offsprings: <strong>yellow 110 (100&#37;)</strong></br>

		parents: yellow 110, seed red 200</br>
		offsprings: pink 100 (25&#37;), yellow 110 (25&#37;), seed red 200 (25&#37;), <strong>purple 210 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>    
	      <p>The red offsprings in this, and the next step, are seed red 200s, which can be fed into Step 1 to produce more yellow 110s if needed. (Two pink 100s produce white 000 (25&#37;), pink 100 (50&#37;), or seed red 200 (25&#37;).)</p>

	      <p>The purple offsprings in this step are the same as the parent purple 210, and they can be fed back into Step 3 to produce more purple 210s and green 220s (and seed red 200). Two green 220s breeding with each other can only produce green 220s.</p>
	      <p>We have seen that pink 100s can spawn in Step 2 above. An alternative pathway for pink mums is mixing seed white 001 with seed red 200: the offsprings are pink 100 (50&#37;) or pink 101 (50&#37;).</p>
	      <p>We have seen that purple 210s can spawn in Steps 2 and 3 above. An alternative pathway for purple mums is mixing two seed white 001s: the offsprings are white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), and purple 002 (25&#37;). Take note that this purple 002 cannot produce green mums when bred with each other, unlike purple 210.</p>

<p>The following is my method for breeding purple pansies. During the process, blue pansies and orange pansies are also obtained.</p>
	<blockquote>
		Step 1</br>
		parents: seed white 001, seed white 001</br>
		offsprings: white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), <strong>blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>

		Step 2</br>
		parents: blue 002, seed red 200</br>
offsprings: <strong>red 101 (100&#37;)</strong></br>
	</blockquote>    
<p>Absolutely prevent the possibility of the seed red 200 self-replicating, lest it get mistaken with the intended hybrid red 101 offspring. See below on breeding layouts. Any excess hybrid red 101s can be used for mass-breeding, with the spawn rate of purple 202s being 6.25&#37;. More hybrid red 101s will also be spawn in the following Step 3, which can be fed into this hybrid red 101 mass-breeding field.</p>
<blockquote>
	Step 3</br>
parents: blue 002, red 101</br>
offsprings: seed white 001 (25&#37;), <strong>BAD! blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong>, red 101 (25&#37;), <strong>GOOD! blue 102 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
	      <p>The two types of blue offsprings, 'bad' blue 002 and 'good' blue 102, need to be tested with a seed yellow 020. With the 'bad' blue 002, the only possible offsprings are yellow 011; with the 'good' blue 102, half of the offsprings are yellow 011, and others are orange 111.</p> 
<blockquote>
	Test 3</br>
parents: blue 002 (bad), seed yellow 020</br>
offsprings: yellow 011 (100&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Test 3</br>
parents: blue 102 (good), seed yellow 020</br>
offsprings: yellow 011 (50&#37;), orange 111 (50&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>		      
<p>During Test 3, if none of the first four offsprings are orange, then the chance that this blue pansy is a 'good' 102 is too low, and it can be removed from the breeding program. (However, you can also not be entirely sure that it is a 'bad' blue 002, so it is best not to feed this blue pansy back into Steps 3 or 2.) (If an offspring in Test 3 is blue, then your testing layout is suboptimal and the blue pansy has self-duplicated. Nonetheless, you can feed this duplicated blue pansy back into Test 3, and note VERY CAREFULLY which two blue pansy testees are equivalents.) Move good blue 102s into the following Step 4. (At least two 'good' blue 102s are needed; either have two 'good' blue 102s from Test 3, or have one 'good' blue 102 trasplanted somewhere else for self-duplication).</p>		      
<blockquote>
	Step 4</br>
parents: blue 102, blue 102</br>
offsprings: blue 002 (25&#37;), blue 102 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 202 (25&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
	<p>If needed, any blue offsprings from Step 4 can be fed back to Test 3 for more 'good' blue 102, which can be fed back into Step 4.</p>
	<p>Purple 202 breading with another purple 202 will only result in purple 202.</p>
	<p>Orange pansies can be obtained through Test 3 above (orange 111). There is another easier method for obtaining orange pansies: seed yellow 020 plus seed red 200 always result in orange 110.</p>

	      <p>Next there are two tests, Test 1a and Test 1b. In Test 1a, the red offsprings from Step 1 are tested against seed white 001s: 'bad' red 100s only produce red or white offsprings, whereas 'good' red 101s produce red, white, or blue offsprings.</p>

	      <p>Any red offsprings in Test 1a can be fed back into Test 1a. (Up until a point where you decide that... there are too many red windflowers.

If none of the first eight offsprings are blue, then the chance that a red windflower is a 'good' red 101 is too low, and it is best to remove that red windflower from the breeding program. Any red windflowers that have produced a blue offspring is a 'good' red 101 and can be kept in the testing ground for more blue offsprings.</p> 
	      <p>Blue offsprings from Test 1a progress to Test 1b. In Test 1b, the blue offsprings from Test 1a are tested against seed orange 020s: 'bad' blue 002s only produce orange offsprings, whereas 'good' blue 102s produce orange or pink offsprings.</p>

<p>The seed-bag flowers are: seed white 001, seed yellow 020, and seed red 201. There are four hybrid colours: pink, orange, blue, and purple. The selling prices in bells are: 40 for white, yellow, red; 80 for pink, orange, blue; 240 for purple.</p>
	      <p>The breeding of hyacinths and tulips (next section) are highly similar, but not identical.</p>
	      <h5 id="orangeandpurplehyacinths">orange and purple hyacinths</h5>
<p>The first step is mixing seed yellow 020 and seed red 201.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 020, see red 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>orange 110 (50&#37;)</strong>, <strong>yellow 111 (50&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, make sure that the yellow 111 offsprings are not mistaken with the parent seed yellow 020.</p>
<p>Both orange 110 and yellow 111 can be used for mass-breeding of purple hyacinths, with all three combinations (110–110, 110–111, 111–111) having a spawn rate of purple offsprings at 6.25&#37; (1/16). Although orange 110 plus yellow 111 can also produce purple offsprings, it would be much easier to keep track of things if the orange and (non-seed) yellow hyacinths are placed in separate mass-breeding fields.</p>
	<p>In both the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields, any orange offsprings can be added to the orange mass-breeding field.</p>
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn orange 110 at 25&#37;, and orange 120 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn orange 110 at 6.25&#37;, and orange 120 at 3.125&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many of them have genes that will not lead to purple hyacinths.</p>	
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple hyacinths:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120 is to separate out any orange offspring, have it breed with a seed yellow 020, and move it back to the orange mass-breeding field after it has produced one orange offspring, and repeat the process with the new orange offspring. If the orange hyacinth is orange 110, then the chance of getting orange 120 is raised to 25&#37;.</p> 
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 020, orange 110</br>
offsprings: yellow 010 (25&#37;), seed yellow 020 (25&#37;), orange 110 (25&#37;), <strong>orange 120 (25&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this extra step is not necessarily beneficial, as:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>there is no benefit if the orange hyacinths is already an orange 120</li> 
	<li>if it is an orange 110, the probabily of spawning orange 120 is only raised from 12.5&#37; in the mass-breeding field to 25&#37;</li>
	<li>the orange hyacinth is decommissioned from the mass-breeding field for at least one day, often many more</li>
	<li>(two orange 120s do not spawn blue hyacinths; see below)</li>
</ul>	
<p>But it is probably useful to know that there is such an option if you are extremely unlucky with the orange mass-breeding field.</p>	
<p>Blue hyacinths can spawn in the mass-breeding fields, and the ones spawn in the <strong>orange</strong> mass-breeding field</em> (blue 210) are beneficial in breeding purple hyacinths. Both [orange 110 + orange 110] and [orange 110 + orange 120] spawn blue 210 at 12.5&#37;. (On the other hand, [orange 120 + orange 120] do not spawn blue hyacinths.) Two blue 210s spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: blue 210, blue 210</br>
offsprings: red 200 (25&#37;), blue 210 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>Any blue hyacinths offspring from this step can be used for breeding more blue 210 or purple 220</p>
<p>(On the other hand, blue hyacinths spawn in the <em>yellow</em> mass-breeding field can be either blue 210 or blue 002, and hence it is best not to use blue hyacinths from the yellow mass-breeding field, if the purpose is to breed purple hyacinths.)</p>
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple hyacinths, purple hyacinths from two orange hyacinth parents are purple 210; purple hyacinths from one orange hyacinth and one yellow hyacinth 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple hyacinths from two yellow hyacinth 111 parents can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple hyacinths breeding with each other will only result in purple hyacinths.</p>
<h5 id="bluehyacinths">blue hyacinths</h5>
	      <p>Blue hyacinths can be obtained through mass-breeding orange 110&#47;120 or mass-breeding yellow 111 during the process of obtaining purple hyacinths (see previous section). An easier method of obtaining blue hyacinths is breeding two seed white 001s:<p> 
<blockquote>
	parents: seed white 001, seed white 001</br>
offsprings: white 000 (25&#37;), seed white 001 (50&#37;), <strong>blue 002 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this blue 002 cannot spawn purple hyacinths when bred with each other, unlike the blue 210 which can be obtained from orange hyacinths (see previous section).</p>		      
<h5 id="pinkhyacinths">pink hyacinths</h5>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed white 001, seed red 201</br>
offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, pink tulips can also appear in a mass-breeding field of yellow 111s (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;.</p> 
	<p>All pink hyacinths are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (37.5&#37; = 3/8), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (31.25&#37; = 5/16), blue 002 (6.25&#37; = 1/16).</p>

<h5 id="orangeandpurpletulips">orange and purple tulips</h5>
<p>The first step is mixing seed yellow 020 and seed red 201.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 020, see red 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>orange 110 (50&#37;)</strong>, <strong>yellow 111 (50&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, make sure that the yellow 111 offsprings are not mistaken with the parent seed yellow 020.</p>
<p>Both orange 110 and yellow 111 can be used for mass-breeding of purple tulips, with all three combinations (110–110, 110–111, 111–111) having a spawn rate of purple offsprings at 6.25&#37; (1/16). Although orange 110 plus yellow 111 can also produce purple offsprings, it would be much easier to keep track of things if the orange and (non-seed) yellow tulips are placed in separate mass-breeding fields.</p>
	<p>In both the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields, any orange offsprings can be added to the orange mass-breeding field.</p>
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn orange 110 at 25&#37;, and orange 120 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn orange 110 at 6.25&#37;, and orange 120 at 3.125&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, any yellow offsprings from either the orange or yellow mass-breeding field should be removed from the breeding program, as many of them have genes that will not lead to purple tulips.</p>	
<p>Orange 120 is better than orange 110 in terms of spawn rate of purple tulips:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn purple 220 at 6.25&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 120 plus orange 120 spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>One way of increasing the number of orange 120 is to separate out any orange offspring, have it breed with a seed yellow 020, and move it back to the orange mass-breeding field after it has produced one orange offspring, and repeat the process with the new orange offspring. If the orange tulip is orange 110, then the chance of getting orange 120 is raised to 25&#37;.</p> 
<blockquote>
	parents: seed yellow 020, orange 110</br>
offsprings: yellow 010 (25&#37;), seed yellow 020 (25&#37;), orange 110 (25&#37;), <strong>orange 120 (25&#37;)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this extra step is not necessarily beneficial, as:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>there is no benefit if the orange tulip is already an orange 120</li> 
	<li>if it is an orange 110, the probabily of spawning orange 120 is only raised from 12.5&#37; in the mass-breeding field to 25&#37;</li>
	<li>the orange tulip is decommissioned from the mass-breeding field for at least one day, often many more</li>
	<li>(two orange 120s do not spawn black tulips; see below)</li>
</ul>	
<p>But it is probably useful to know that there is such an option if you are extremely unlucky with the orange mass-breeding field.</p>	
<p>Black tulips can spawn in the mass-breeding fields. There are two types of black tulips, black 200 and black 210, with black 210 being the 'good' one in terms of breeding purple offsprings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 110 spawn 'bad' black 200 at 6.25&#37;, and 'good' black 210 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>orange 110 plus orange 120 spawn 'good' black 210 at 12.5&#37;</li>
	<li>(orange 120 plus orange 120 does not spawn black tulips)</li>
	<li>yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn 'bad' black 200 at 1.5625&#37;, and 'good' black 210 at 3.125&#37;</li>
</ul>
<p>Black tulips from the orange and yellow mass-breeding fields can be tested with seed white 001s. 'Bad' black 200 plus seed white 001 only spawn red or pink offsprings, while 'good' black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn yellow, orange, red, or pink offsprings.</p>
<blockquote>
	Test</br>
	parents: seed white 001, black 200 (bad)</br>
offsprings: red 100 (50&#37;), pink 101 (50&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	Test</br>
	parents: seed white 001, black 210 (good)</br>
offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), pink 101 (25&#37;), orange 110 (25&#37;), yellow 111 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
      <p>If none of the first four offsprings are yellow or orange, then the probability that the black tulip is black 210 is getting too low, and can be removed from the breeding program.</p>	
<p>Two 'good' black 210s spawn purple 220 at 25&#37;.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: black 210, black 210</br>
offsprings: red 200 (25&#37;), blue 210 (50&#37;), <strong>purple 220 (25&#37;)</strong></br>
</blockquote>
<p>Two 'good' black 210 can be used to breed purple 220.</p>
<blockquote>
	parents: black 210, black 210
	offsprings: black 200 (25&#37;), black 210 (50&#37;), purple 220 (25&#37;)
</blockquote>
<p>Any black tulip offsprings have to be retested with seed white 001s, and the 'good' black 210s can be used to produce more purple 220s.</p>	           
	      <p>If you care about the genes of the purple tulips, purple tulips from two orange tulip parents are purple 210; purple tulips from one orange tulip and one yellow tulip 111 can be purple 210 or 211; purple tulips from two yellow tulip 111 parents can be purple 210, 211, or 212. Any purple tulips breeding with each other will only result in purple tulips.</p>
<h5 id="blacktulips">black tulips</h5>
	      <p>Black hyacinths can be obtained through mass-breeding orange 110&#47;120 or mass-breeding yellow 111 during the process of obtaining purple tulips (see previous section). An easier method of obtaining black tulips is breeding two seed red 201s:<p> 
<blockquote>
	parents: seed red 201, seed white 201</br>
offsprings: <strong>black 200 (25&#37;)</strong>, seed red 201 (50&#37;), red 202 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this black 200 cannot spawn purple tulips when bred with each other, unlike the black 210 which can be obtained from some orange and yellow tulips. (See the previous section first!)</p>		      
<h5 id="pinktulips">pink tulips</h5>
<blockquote>
	parents: seed white 001, seed red 201</br>
offsprings: red 100 (25&#37;), <strong>pink 101 (50&#37;)</strong>, white 102 (25&#37;)</br>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, pink tulips can also appear in a mass-breeding field of yellow 111s (see above): yellow 111 plus yellow 111 spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. Orange 110 plus yellow 111 also spawn pink 101 at 6.25&#37;. If you are testing black tulips, black 200 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 50&#37;, while black 210 plus seed white 001 spawn pink 101 at 25&#37;.</p> 
	<p>All pink tulips are pink 101. Two pink 101s breeding with each other results in the following offsprings: red (31.25&#37; = 5/16), pink 101 (25&#37;), white (37.5&#37; = 3/8), black 200 (6.25&#37; = 1/16).</p>
