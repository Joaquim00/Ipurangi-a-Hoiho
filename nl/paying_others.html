<h3><a id="paying-others" class="anchor" href="#paying-others" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paying others</h3>
<p>Covered in this page are options that are not public transport (i.e. not having to share the vehicle with other unknown passengers), but also not do-it-yourself. For airborne transportation, see the <a href="fly.html#other-options">fly</a> page.</p>

<a id="taxis" class="anchor" href="#taxis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Taxis</h3>
<p>There are plenty of taxis in the Netherlands. Many line up at the usual places that you would expect them: airports, larger train stations, night-life areas. You can also ring taxi companies to make a booking, and some also have online/app booking options. Some companies cater for customers with specific mobility needs.</p>

<p>UberPop has been ruled illegal in the Netherlands (and also in Belgium, France, Germany), and is actively cracked down on by the government. Other Uber services are available in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (August 2016). There are also other similar local start-ups. See, e.g. Remco Janssen's reply to <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-well-do-you-recommend-Uber-in-Amsterdam" target="_blank">this question</a>, and also <a href="http://siliconcanals.nl/?s=taxi" target="_blank">his blog</a> (most posts are in Dutch, but some are in English).</p>

<p>Given the density of inland waterways in the Netherlands, there are many watertaxi companies in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>In Dutch, 'taxi' is <em>taxi</em>, and 'watertaxi' is <em>watertaxi</em>. You can easily search details of taxi and watertaxi companies on the internet. There are strict licensing laws on the drivers. In the unlikely case that a <em>klacht</em> 'complain' needs to be made, try contacting the taxi company, or try <a href="http://www.taxiklacht.nl/pages/taxiklacht/HOME?windowuid=uid1471815725" target="_blank">taxiklacht.nl</a>, or the <a href="https://www.politie.nl/en/contact" target="_blank">police</a> for more serious matters.</p>

<a id="car-pooling" class="anchor" href="#car-pooling" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Car-pooling</h3>
<p>Car pooling is popular in the Netherlands, for both domestic and international trips. The biggest company is <a href="https://www.blablacar.nl/" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a>. You type in your inteded origin and destination, e.g. from Rotterdam to Brussels, from Istanbul to Amsterdam. You will then see a list of drivers who are going on the same or similar trajectory, if there is a match. It also tells you how much that journey costs per seat, and how many empty seats are left. You can further constraint the search results by factors like time and date, and 'expertise level' of the driver. You contact the driver through the website, and you can make further arrangements with the driver about details like where to pick you up and where to drop you off, how much detour they are willing to make, how much luggage they can take, and so forth.</p>

<p>From the other side of this interaction, as a driver, you can post on BlaBlaCar your intended journey, date, and time, and BlaBlaCar will give you an advisory range of price that you can charge each passenger.</p>

<p>There are also other similar companies and platforms. Sorry I don't have a lot of experience on this; you'll have to do your own search online for carpooling companies/platforms.</p>
