A little lesson on the Netherlands and its neighbours, with many links from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. (Information in Wikipedia is not necessarily accurate!)

<h3>
<a id="the-netherlands" class="anchor" href="#the-netherlands" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Netherlands, Holland, etc.</h3>

<p>The Netherlands is a country. The adjectival form, and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" target="_blank">people</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">language</a>, are called <ins>Dutch</ins> in English. The Netherlands consists of the 12 provinces in <ins>European Netherlands</ins> and the 3 special municipalities in <ins>Caribbean Netherlands<ins>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">12 provinces</a> in European Netherlands are:</p>
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen_(province)" target="_blank">Groningen</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drenthe" target="_blank">Drenthe</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland" target="_blank">Fryslân</a> (<em>Friesland</em> in Dutch)</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overijssel" target="_blank">Overijssel</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Holland" target="_blank">Noord-Holland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland" target="_blank">Zuid-Holland</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburg_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Limburg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and the 3 special municipalities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Netherlands" target="_blank">Caribbean Netherlands</a> are:</p> 
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaire" target="_blank">Bonaire</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius" target="_blank">Sint Eustatius</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba" target="_blank">Saba</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(The special municipalities have the functions of municipalities, and some functions of provinces.) The pages here in <ins>How to NL</ins> are mainly about European Netherlands, while Caribbean Netherlands will also be touched upon. (I will try to learn more about the Caribbean Netherlands in the near future.)</p> 

<p>The governing body above the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank"><ins>The Kingdom of the Netherlands</ins></a>, which is a sovereign state. The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of 4 constituent countries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba" target="_blank">Aruba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" target="_blank">Curaçao</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Maarten" target="_blank">Sint Maarten</a>. The latter three are entirely in the Caribbean. While Caribbean Netherlands and European Netherlands have basically the same laws, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have their own legal systems. The only matters shared amongst the four consituent countries are things like nationality laws (i.e. they have the same Dutch nationality), foreign affairs, and defence. Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are basically not discussed here in <ins>How to NL</ins>, as they are not The Netherlands.</p>

<p>(Another term you might encounter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Caribbean" target="_blank">Dutch Caribbean</a>, which includes Caribbean Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.)</p>

<p>The Netherlands had a huge colonial empire. In the 20th century, the ex-colonies became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" target="_blank">Indonesia</a> (SE Asia), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname" target="_blank">Suriname</a> (S America). Many Dutch people are originally from, or have ancestors from, these places. Dutch is still spoken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname#Languages" target="_blank">most people in Suriname</a>, and many Dutch words have entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language" target="_blank">Indonesian language</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia" target="_blank">other languages spoken in Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> gained independence from the Netherlands, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a> was in a personal union with the Netherlands (the king of the Netherlands was also the grand duke of Luxembourg). These three soverign states have been – since 1940s – part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux" target="_blank">Benelux Union</a>, which share many policies.</p> 

<p>(Also in the 19th century, British Gold Coast absorbed Dutch Gold Coast and Danish Gold Coast; in the 1950s, British Gold Coast, together with British Togoland, gained independence as Ghana. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire" target="_blank">here</a> for a history of the Dutch empire.)</p>

<p>The Netherlands is often informally referred to as <em>Holland</em>; Holland is in fact a region of the Netherlands (now the provinces of <em>Noord-Holland</em> and <em>Zuid-Holland</em>), albeit the most prosperous one in the country. The using of <em>Holland</em> to refer to the entire Netherlands is somewhat similar to how <em>England</em> is informally used to refer to the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Nonetheless, Dutch people are often not offended when their country is referred to as <em>Holland</em>. They sometimes do that themselves, especially in international sports context. The official tourism website of The Netherlands is called <a href="http://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm" target="_blank">Holland.com</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">capital of the Netherlands</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>. Important royal functions, e.g., coronation, are hold in Amsterdam. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" target="_blank">The Hague</a> (<em>'s-Gravenhage</em> or <em>Den Haag</em> in Dutch) is not (called) the capital; it is the seat of government, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">embassies of foreign countries</a> are also in The Hague.</p> 

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad" target="_blank"><em>Randstad</em></a> is one of the largest Megalopolis in Europe, both in terms of population and economic importance. It consists of Amsterdam, The Hauge, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and smaller cities in between. It contains the port of Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe, and Amsterdam Schiphol airport, one of the largest airports in Europe.</p>

<p>The official language of the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">Dutch</a>. Other than the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dutch is also an official language in Belgium and Suriname. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans" target="_blank">Afrikaans language</a> in South Africa and Namibia is largely mutually intelligible with Dutch. The majority of Dutch people speak very good English, and are usually willing to speak English to foreigners. (Be courteous; don't just assume that everyone <strong>has</strong> to speak English with you.) Many also speak German and/or French.</p>

<p>Regional languages with official status are (West) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frisian_language" target="_blank">Frisian</a> in Fryslân, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papiamento" target="_blank">Papiamentu</a> in Bonaire, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank">English</a> in Sint Eustatius and Saba. Other than Frisian, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages" target="_blank">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a> also recognises the following regional languages in the Netherlands: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Low_Saxon" target="_blank">Dutch Low Saxon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburgish_language" target="_blank">Limgurgish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language" target="_blank">Romani</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish" target="_blank">Yiddish</a>. (See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_dialects" target="_blank">Dutch dialects</a>.)</p>

<p>Traditionally, the dominant religion in European Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism" target="_blank">Calvanistic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" target="_blank">Protestantism</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" target="_blank">Roman Catholicism</a> also has very strong following. The Netherlands was roughly divided into a Protestant north, and Catholic south. These days, most people are not very involved in religion, except in the (Protestant) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Bible Belt</a>, which run roughly from the southwest to the northeast.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is known for its liberalism (or perhaps, pragmatism) in many of its policies. For example, the Netherlands is the first country in the world to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">legalise same-gender marriage</a>. (Same-gender marriage is also available in Caribbean Netherlands. Same-gender marriage is not performed in Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint-Maarten, but marriage performed in the Netherlands is recognised by them.) Drugs are illegal, but there is an official policy of non-enforcement for private usage of drugs that cause relatively low harm. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Drug policy of the Netherlands</a>.) The Dutch government is more concerned about your health, than policing the usage of 'soft' drugs.</p>

<p>Note that in the Netherlands, a <em>coffeeshop</em>, spelt in English, is a place where you can smoke cannibis/marijuana. A place where you can drink coffee is a <em>café</em>. Although <em>coffeeshops</em> are tolerated by the national government, local governments can place extra restrictions on them. For instance, many municipalities, especially the ones near the German or Belgian border, do not allow coffeeshops to serve people not residing in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Abortion and prostitution are legal in the Netherlands. With prostitution, again, local councils can place restrictions on prostitution venues. 'Window' prostitution, which the Netherlands is famous for, can be found only in about 10 cities. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Prostitution in the Netherlands</a>.)</p>

<p>European Netherlands borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Federal Republic of Germany</a> consists of 16 constituent states. The two states that border Netherlands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony" target="_blank"><em>Niedersachsen</em></a> (Lower Saxony) in the north, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia" target="_blank"><em>Nordrhein-Westfalen</em></a> (North Rhine-Westphalia) to the south. Nordrhein-Westfalen is the most populous state of Germany, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine-Ruhr" target="_blank">Rhine-Ruhr</a> area, close to the Netherlands, is another large and important Megalopolis in Europe.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire" target="_blank">German empire</a> ended in 1918, when it became a federal republic; at the end of World War I in 1918, Germany lost all its colonies. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" target="_blank">German language</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages" target="_blank">West Germanic language</a> like Dutch. German has official status at national level in six countries: Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium. Outside of Europe, the German language is most visible in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language_in_Namibia" target="_blank">Namibia</a>, one of Germany's ex-colonies. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_dialects" target="_blank">German dialects</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Kingdom of Belgium</a> is a federal constitutional monarchy. There is a national government, but much of the power is devloved to the various sub-national governments. Most importantly, there is the governments of the three regions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Region" target="_blank">Flanders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia" target="_blank">Wallonia</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels" target="_blank">Brussels-Captial Region</a>. Flanders is mostly Dutch-speaking. Wallonia is mostly French-speaking, with a German-speaking region in the extreme east. Brussels is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, but in reality mostly French speaking. Other than these three sub-national governments, there is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_French_Community" target="_blank">Government of the French Community</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_German-speaking_Community" target="_blank">Government of the German-speaking Community</a>. (The government of Flanders is also the government of the the Dutch-speaking Community.) Belgium did not suffer badly during its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation" target="_blank">589 days without an elected federal government</a> in 2010–2011, because so much power is devolved to the various sub-national government.</p>

<p>Language is a delicate political issue in Belgium. Historically, the minority French language had much more political power than the majority Dutch language. These days, the Flemish government and Wallonian government make little concessions for each other's language. For example, on road signs in Flanders, names of places in Wallonia (and France) often only appear in their Dutch version, and similarly in Wallonia, names of places in Flanders often only appear in their French version. Sometimes the Dutch place name and the French place name of the same place can look very different. For example, the Wallonian city of <em>Mons</em> is known as <em>Bergen</em> in Dutch. The Flemish city of Antwerp is known as <em>Antwerpen</em> in Dutch, but <em>Anvers</em> in French. For foreigners travelling in Belgium, it is advisable to be versed in the placenames in Belgium, and also nearby regions, in both Dutch and French, and perhaps also German. For example, the French city of <em>Lille</em> (which was originally Flemish) is known as <em>Rijsel</em> in Dutch. The German city of <em>Aachen</em> is known as <em>Aken</em> in Dutch, but <em>Aix-la-Chapelle</em> in French. The Wallonian city of <em>Liège</em> is known as <em>Luik</em> in Dutch, and <em>Lüttich</em> in German.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the ex-Belgian colonies gained independence as (what are now known as) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" target="_blank">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda" target="_blank">Rwanda</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi" target="_blank">Burundi</a>. They all have French as their official language, or one of their official languages. (Dutch did not have prestige in Belgium at that time.)</p>

<p>The official languages of Belgium are Dutch, French, and German. Belgian Standard Dutch is phonetically noticeably different from Netherlands Standard Dutch, and there are some lexical differences from Netherlands Standard Dutch, but grammatically they are both based on the urban dialects of Holland. 'Flemish' can refer to either Belgian Standard Dutch, or the local Flemish dialects of Dutch. The same can be said of the relationship between Belgian Standard French and French Standard French, and 'Wallonian'.</p>

<p>Belgium is traditionally Roman Catholic. However, these days few people are actively involved in religion. Flanders are somewhat more religious than Brussels and Wallonia.</p>

<p>Belgium is also relatively socially progressive. Belgium was the second country in the world to legalised same-gender marriage. The preceding prime minister is openly gay (2016). The possession of a very small ammount of cannibis/marijuana is legal in Belgium, but it is not as openly sold in the Belgium as in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</a> is sandwiched between Belgium, Germany, and France. After the napoleonic era, the kings of the Netherlands were also the grand dukes of Luxembourg. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">King William III of the Netherlands</a> died in 1890, due to differences in the succession laws of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the throne in the Netherlands was passed to his daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Queen Wilhelmina</a>, but in Luxembourg to his [17th cousin once removed through male line, or wife's half-uncle] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe,_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg" target="_blank">Grand Duke Adolphe</a>. The royal families of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands are very close to each other in multiple ways.</p>

<p>The official languages of Belgium are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourgish_language" target="_blank">Luxembourgish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" target="_blank">French</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" target="_blank">German</a>. Unlike Belgium, where language use is mostly geographically-based, in Luxembourg basically all citizens are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism_in_Luxembourg" target="_blank">multilingual</a> in at least three languages; all three languages are introduced before secondary school. The law is in French.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is somewhat less socially-progressive than the Netherlands and Belgium. Drugs are illegal. Same-gender marriage was legalised much later (2015). Nonetheless, currently (2016; since December 2013), the prime minister and the deputy prime minister of Luxembourg, from two different political parties, are both openly gay; basically no one in Luxembourg cares about the sexual orientation of politicians.</p>

<p>To the south of Belgium and Luxembourg is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" target="_blank">French Republic</a>. France has 18 regions, with 13 of them in Europe (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France" target="_blank">Metropolitan France</a>), and 5 of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_region" target="_blank">overseas</a>, situated in the wider Caribbean region, or off the East African coast. France also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_overseas_departments_and_territories" target="_blank">eight other overseas territories</a>, which have different sets of laws than the 18 regions of France proper (the 18 regions are often referred as <em>la France entière</em> 'the whole of France' by the French government). The official language is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" target="_blank">French</a>.</p>

<p>Close to France and Belgium, across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel" target="_blank">English Channel</a>, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>. The <em>de facto</em> official language of UK is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank">English</a>, the language that you are reading in.</p>

<p>European Netherlands is within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a>. The Schengen Area also includes Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Metropolitan France, and other countries. Within the Schengen Area, there are no systematic border checks on the borders amongst the member states. However, you could still be stopped at or near the border and asked for ID by the police, just like how you can be asked anywhere else in the country. In the Netherlands, it is compulsory to show you ID in certain situations (see <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/identification-documents/contents/compulsory-identification" target="_blank">what the government says</a> on this issue).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Caribbean" target="_blank">Dutch Caribbean</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_overseas_departments_and_territories" target="_blank">Overseas France</a>, are outside the Schengen Area.
