A little lesson on the Netherlands and its neighbours, with many links from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. (Information in Wikipedia is not necessarily accurate!)

<h3>
<a id="the-netherlands" class="anchor" href="#the-netherlands" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Netherlands, Holland, etc.</h3>

<p>The Netherlands is a country. The adjectival form, and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" target="_blank">people</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">language</a>, are called <ins>Dutch</ins> in English. The Netherlands consists of the 12 provinces in <ins>European Netherlands</ins> and the 3 special municipalities in <ins>Caribbean Netherlands<ins>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">12 provinces</a> in European Netherlands are:</p>
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen_(province)" target="_blank">Groningen</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drenthe" target="_blank">Drenthe</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland" target="_blank">Fryslân</a> (<em>Friesland</em> in Dutch)</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overijssel" target="_blank">Overijssel</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland" target="_blank">Flevoland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelderland" target="_blank">Gelderland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_(province)" target="_blank">Utrecht</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Holland" target="_blank">Noord-Holland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland" target="_blank">Zuid-Holland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeland" target="_blank">Zeeland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Brabant" target="_blank">Noord-Brabant</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburg_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Limburg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and the 3 special municipalities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Netherlands" target="_blank">Caribbean Netherlands</a> are:</p> 
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaire" target="_blank">Bonaire</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius" target="_blank">Sint Eustatius</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba" target="_blank">Saba</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(The special municipalities have the functions of municipalities, and some functions of provinces.) The pages here in <ins>How to NL</ins> are mainly about European Netherlands, while Caribbean Netherlands will also be touched upon. (I will try to learn more about the Caribbean Netherlands in the near future.)</p> 

<p>The governing body above the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank"><ins>The Kingdom of the Netherlands</ins></a>, which is a sovereign state. The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of 4 constituent countries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba" target="_blank">Aruba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" target="_blank">Curaçao</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Maarten" target="_blank">Sint Maarten</a>. The latter three are entirely in the Caribbean. While Caribbean Netherlands and European Netherlands have basically the same laws, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have their own legal systems. The only matters shared amongst the four consituent countries are things like nationality laws (i.e. they have the same Dutch nationality), foreign affairs, and defence. Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are basically not discussed here in <ins>How to NL</ins>, as they are not The Netherlands.</p>

<p>(Another term you might encounter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Caribbean" target="_blank">Dutch Caribbean</a>, which includes Caribbean Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.)</p>

<p>The Netherlands had a huge colonial empire. In the 20th century, the ex-colonies became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" target="_blank">Indonesia</a> (SE Asia), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname" target="_blank">Suriname</a> (S America). Many Dutch people are originally from, or have ancestors from, these places. Dutch is still spoken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname#Languages" target="_blank">most people in Suriname</a>, and many Dutch words have entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language" target="_blank">Indonesian language</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia" target="_blank">other languages spoken in Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> gained independence from the Netherlands, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a> was in a personal union with the Netherlands (the king of the Netherlands was also the grand duke of Luxembourg). These three soverign states have been – since 1940s – part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux" target="_blank">Benelux Union</a>, which share many policies.</p> 

<p>(Also in the 19th century, British Gold Coast absorbed Dutch Gold Coast and Danish Gold Coast; in the 1950s, British Gold Coast, together with British Togoland, gained independence as Ghana. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire" target="_blank">here</a> for a history of the Dutch empire.)</p>

<p>The Netherlands is often informally referred to as <em>Holland</em>; Holland is in fact a region of the Netherlands (now the provinces of <em>Noord-Holland</em> and <em>Zuid-Holland</em>), albeit the most prosperous one in the country. The using of <em>Holland</em> to refer to the entire Netherlands is somewhat similar to how <em>England</em> is informally used to refer to the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Nonetheless, Dutch people are often not offended when their country is referred to as <em>Holland</em>. They sometimes do that themselves, especially in international sports context. The official tourism website of The Netherlands is called <a href="http://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm" target="_blank">Holland.com</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">capital of the Netherlands</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>. Important royal functions, e.g., coronation, are hold in Amsterdam. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" target="_blank">The Hague</a> (<em>'s-Gravenhage</em> or <em>Den Haag</em> in Dutch) is not (called) the capital; it is the seat of government, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">embassies of foreign countries</a> are also in The Hague.</p> 

<p>The official language of the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">Dutch</a>. Other than the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dutch is also an official language in Belgium and Suriname. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans" target="_blank">Afrikaans language</a> in South Africa and Namibia is largely mutually intelligible with Dutch. The majority of Dutch people speak very good English, and are usually willing to speak English to foreigners. (Be courteous; don't just assume that everyone <strong>has</strong> to speak English with you.) Many also speak German and/or French.</p>

<p>Regional languages with official status are (West) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frisian_language" target="_blank">Frisian</a> in Fryslân, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papiamento" target="_blank">Papiamentu</a> in Bonaire, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank">English</a> in Sint Eustatius and Saba. Other than Frisian, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages" target="_blank">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a> also recognises the following regional languages in the Netherlands: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Low_Saxon" target="_blank">Dutch Low Saxon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburgish_language" target="_blank">Limgurgish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language" target="_blank">Romani</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish" target="_blank">Yiddish</a>. (See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_dialects" target="_blank">Dutch dialects</a>.)</p>

<p>Traditionally, the dominant religion in European Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism" target="_blank">Calvanistic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" target="_blank">Protestantism</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" target="_blank">Roman Catholicism</a> also has very strong following. The Netherlands was roughly divided into a Protestant north, and Catholic south. These days, most people are not very involved in religion, except in the (Protestant) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Bible Belt</a>, which run roughly from the southwest to the northeast.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is known for its liberalism (or perhaps, pragmatism) in many of its policies. For example, the Netherlands is the first country in the world to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">legalise same-gender marriage</a>. (Same-gender marriage is also available in Caribbean Netherlands. Same-gender marriage is not performed in Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint-Maarten, but marriage performed in the Netherlands is recognised by them.) Drugs are illegal, but there is an official policy of non-enforcement for private usage of drugs that cause relatively low harm. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Drug policy of the Netherlands</a>.) The Dutch government is more concerned about your health, than policing the usage of 'soft' drugs.</p>

<p>Note that in the Netherlands, a <em>coffeeshop</em>, spelt in English, is a place where you can smoke cannibis/marijuana. A place where you can drink coffee is a <em>café</em>. Although <em>coffeeshops</em> are tolerated by the national government, local governments can place extra restrictions on them. For instance, many municipalities, especially the ones near the German or Belgian border, do not allow coffeeshops to serve people not residing in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Abortion and prostitution are legal in the Netherlands. With prostitution, again, local councils can place restrictions on prostitution venues. 'Window' prostitution, which the Netherlands is famous for, can be found only in about 10 cities. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Prostitution in the Netherlands</a>.)</p>

<p>European Netherlands is within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Zone</a>, so theoratically there are no border checks on the land borders with Germany and Belgium, or with flights within the Schengen Zone. (But then you can still be stopped at or near the border and asked for ID by police, just like how you can be asked anywhere else in the country.) Caribbean Netherlands is outside the Schengen Area, similar to French <em> départements d’outre-mer</em>. See also these <strong>un</strong>official sources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_Schengen_Area" target="_blank">visa policy of the Schengen Area</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands_in_the_Caribbean" target="_blank">visa policy of the Dutch Caribbean</a>. European Netherlands uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro" target="_blank">Euro €</a>, whereas Caribbean Netherlands uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" target="_blank">US dollar $</a>.</p>
