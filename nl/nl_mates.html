<p>The Netherlands (<em>Nederland</em> in Dutch) is a country. The adjectival form, and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" target="_blank">people</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">language</a>, are called <ins>Dutch</ins> in English. The Netherlands consists of the 12 provinces in <ins>European Netherlands</ins> and the 3 special municipalities in <ins>Caribbean Netherlands</ins>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">12 provinces</a> in European Netherlands are:</p>
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen_(province)" target="_blank">Groningen</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drenthe" target="_blank">Drenthe</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland" target="_blank">Fryslân</a> (<em>Friesland</em> in Dutch)</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overijssel" target="_blank">Overijssel</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland" target="_blank">Flevoland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelderland" target="_blank">Gelderland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_(province)" target="_blank">Utrecht</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Holland" target="_blank">Noord-Holland</a> (North Holland)</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland" target="_blank">Zuid-Holland</a> (South Holland)</li>

      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburg_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Limburg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and the 3 special municipalities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Netherlands" target="_blank">Caribbean Netherlands</a> are:</p> 
<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaire" target="_blank">Bonaire</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius" target="_blank">Sint Eustatius</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba" target="_blank">Saba</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(The special municipalities have the functions of municipalities, and some functions of provinces.) The pages here in <ins>How to NL</ins> are mainly about European Netherlands, while Caribbean Netherlands will also be touched upon. (I will try to learn more about the Caribbean Netherlands in the near future.)</p> 

<p>The governing body above the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank"><ins>The Kingdom of the Netherlands</ins></a> (<em>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</em> in Dutch), which is a sovereign state. The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of 4 constituent countries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba" target="_blank">Aruba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" target="_blank">Curaçao</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Maarten" target="_blank">Sint Maarten</a>. The latter three are entirely in the Caribbean. While Caribbean Netherlands and European Netherlands have basically the same laws, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have their own legal systems. The only matters shared amongst the four consituent countries are things like nationality laws (i.e. they have the same Dutch nationality), foreign affairs, and defence. Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are basically not discussed here in <ins>How to NL</ins>, as they are not The Netherlands.</p>

<p>Another term you might encounter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Caribbean" target="_blank">Dutch Caribbean</a>, which includes Caribbean Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy. The current monarch is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem-Alexander_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">King Willem-Alexander</a>, who ascended the throne in 2013. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag" target="_blank"><em>Koningsdag</em></a>, or King's day, is a national holiday, and celebrations are held kingdom-wide. It falls on the 27th of April (or the 26th if the 27th is a Sunday). The preceding monarch, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Queen Beatrix</a> (now titled Princess), abdicated in 2013. <em>Koninginnedag</em>, or Queen's day, was on the 30th April. Thesedays, there are still foreign tourists, relying on old information, turning up in the Netherlands on the 30th April expecting festivities; they become disappointed when they are told that the Queen's day are no longer celebrated, and they have missed the King's day by just a few days.</p>

<p>The Netherlands had a huge colonial empire. In the 20th century, the ex-colonies became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" target="_blank">Indonesia</a> (Southeast Asia), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname" target="_blank">Suriname</a> (South America). Many Dutch people are originally from, or have ancestors from, these places. Dutch is still spoken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname#Languages" target="_blank">most people in Suriname</a>, and many Dutch words have entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language" target="_blank">Indonesian language</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia" target="_blank">other languages spoken in Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> gained independence from the Netherlands, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a> was in a personal union with the Netherlands (the king of the Netherlands was also the grand duke of Luxembourg). These three soverign states are – since 1940s – part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux" target="_blank">Benelux Union</a>. The Benelux states coorporate on many matters.</p> 

<p>(Also in the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_(British_colony)" target="_blank">British Gold Coast</a> absorbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Gold_Coast" target="_blank">Dutch Gold Coast</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Gold_Coast" target="_blank">Danish Gold Coast</a>, and local kingdoms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire" target="_blank">Ashanti</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fante_Confederacy" target="_blank">Fante</a> in particular); in the 1950s, British Gold Coast, including British Togoland, gained independence as Ghana. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire" target="_blank">here</a> for a history of the Dutch empire.)</p>

<p>The Netherlands is often informally referred to as <em>Holland</em>; Holland is in fact a region of the Netherlands (now the provinces of <em>Noord-Holland</em> and <em>Zuid-Holland</em>), albeit the most prosperous region in the country. The using of <em>Holland</em> to refer to the entire Netherlands is somewhat similar to how <em>England</em> is informally used to refer to the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Nonetheless, Dutch people are often not offended when their country is referred to as <em>Holland</em>. They sometimes do that themselves, especially in international sports context. The official tourism website of the Netherlands is called <a href="http://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm" target="_blank">Holland.com</a>. Holland is a better known brand than the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">capital of the Netherlands</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>. Important royal functions, e.g., coronation, are hold in Amsterdam. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" target="_blank">The Hague</a> (<em>'s-Gravenhage</em> or <em>Den Haag</em> in Dutch) is not (called) the capital; it is the seat of the national government. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Embassies of foreign countries</a> are in The Hague. Many important international and European institutions are in The Hague, e.g. International Court of Justice, Europol. The King and his family live in The Hague region.</p> 

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad" target="_blank"><em>Randstad</em></a> is one of the largest Megalopolis in Europe, both in terms of population and economic importance. It consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" target="_blank">The Hague</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam" target="_blank">Rotterdam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht" target="_blank">Utrecht</a>, and smaller cities in between. It contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Rotterdam" target="_blank">Port of Rotterdam</a>, the largest seaport in Europe, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol" target="_blank">Amsterdam Schiphol Airport</a>, one of the largest airports in Europe.</p>

<p><em>Nether-</em> in Netherlands means 'low'. The Netherlands is known as <em>Pays-Bas</em> 'Low Countries' in French. About one-fourth of European Netherlands lie below the sea level, and about one-fourth is between 0 to 1 meter above sea level. The entire coast of European Netherlands is protected by dykes, levees, locks, dams, sluices, and storm surge barriers. The highest land point in European Netherlands is 322m above sea level, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaalserberg" target="_blank">Vaalserberg</a>, very near the <em>Drielandenpunt</em> 'Three-country point', the tripoint with Belgium and Germany. (The road up there is called <em>Viergrenzenweg</em> 'Four-borders way', because there also used to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Moresnet" target="_blank">Neutral Moresnet</a> sharing the quadripoint.) On the Dutch side of the <em>Drielandenpunt</em> is a <a href="http://www.drielandenpunt.nl/" target="_blank">maze</a>.</p>

<p>The highest point in the Kingdom of the Netherlands is 887m above sea level, the summit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Scenery" target="_blank">Mount Scenery</a> in Saba, a potentially active volcano.</p>

<p>The official language of the Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language" target="_blank">Dutch</a>. Other than the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dutch is also an official language in Belgium and Suriname. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans" target="_blank">Afrikaans language</a> in South Africa and Namibia is largely mutually intelligible with Dutch. The majority of Dutch people speak very good English, and are usually willing to speak English to foreigners. (Be courteous; don't just assume that everyone <strong>has</strong> to speak English with you.) Many also speak German and/or French.</p>

<p>Regional languages with official status or recognition are (West) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frisian_language" target="_blank">Frisian</a> in Fryslân, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papiamento" target="_blank">Papiamentu</a> in Bonaire, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank">English</a> in Sint Eustatius and Saba. Other than Frisian, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages" target="_blank">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a> also recognises the following regional languages in the Netherlands: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Low_Saxon" target="_blank">Dutch Low Saxon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburgish_language" target="_blank">Limburgish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language" target="_blank">Romani</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish" target="_blank">Yiddish</a>. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_dialects" target="_blank">Dutch dialects</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the dominant religion in European Netherlands is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism" target="_blank">Calvanistic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" target="_blank">Protestantism</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" target="_blank">Roman Catholicism</a> is also prominent. The Netherlands was roughly divided into a Protestant north, and Catholic south. These days, most people are not, or not very, involved in religion, except in the (Protestant) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)" target="_blank">Bible Belt</a>, which runs roughly from the southwest to the northeast.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is known for its liberalism (or perhaps, pragmatism) in many of its policies. For example, the Netherlands is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">first country in the world</a> to legalise same-gender marriage. (Same-gender marriage is also available in Caribbean Netherlands. Same-gender marriage is not performed in Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint-Maarten, but marriage performed in the Netherlands is recognised by them.) Drugs are illegal, but there is an official policy of non-enforcement for private usage of drugs that cause relatively low harm. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Drug policy of the Netherlands</a>.) The Dutch government is more concerned about your health, than policing the usage of 'soft' drugs. The Dutch authorities often give advice on precautions that one has to take in order to take soft drugs safely, if one chooses to take soft drugs.</p>

<p>Note that in the Netherlands, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeeshop_(Netherlands)" target="_blank"><em>coffeeshop</em></a>, spelt in English, is a licensed place which sells cannibis/marijuana (they can also sell drinks and food, but not alcoholic drinks or other drugs). A place which sells coffee and food is a <em>café</em>. (A <em>café</em> can also be a bar.) Although <em>coffeeshops</em> are tolerated by the national government, local governments can place extra restrictions on them. For instance, many municipalities, especially the ones near the German or Belgian border, do not allow coffeeshops to serve people not residing in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Abortion and prostitution are legal in the Netherlands. With prostitution, again, local authorities can place restrictions on prostitution venues. 'Window' prostitution, which the Netherlands is famous for, can be found in about 10 cities. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Prostitution in the Netherlands</a>.)</p>

<p>European Netherlands borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south.</p>

<h4>
<a id="germany" class="anchor" href="#germany" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Germany</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Federal Republic of Germany</a> (<em>Bundesrepublik Deutschland</em> in German) consists of 16 constituent states. The two states that border Netherlands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony" target="_blank"><em>Niedersachsen</em></a> (Lower Saxony) in the north, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia" target="_blank"><em>Nordrhein-Westfalen</em></a> (North Rhine-Westphalia) to the south. Nordrhein-Westfalen is the most populous state of Germany, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine-Ruhr" target="_blank">Rhine-Ruhr</a> area within it, close to the Netherlands, is another major megalopolis in Europe.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire" target="_blank">German empire</a> ended in 1918, when it became a federal republic; during the First World War in 1914–1918, Germany lost all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire" target="_blank">its colonies</a> to its enemies. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" target="_blank">German language</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages" target="_blank">West Germanic language</a> like Dutch. German has official status at national level in six countries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Germany</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" target="_blank">Austria</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein" target="_blank">Liechtenstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank">Switzerland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Luxembourg</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a>. Outside Europe, the German language is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language_in_Namibia" target="_blank">most noticeably used</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" target="_blank">Namibia</a>, one of Germany's ex-colonies. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_dialects" target="_blank">German dialects</a>.</p>

<p>Germany refrained from invading the Netherlands during the First World War, but Germany did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_in_World_War_II" target="_blank">invade the Netherlands</a> during the Second World War. Relations gradually mended after the War. Germany is now by far the largest trading partner of the Netherlands. Huge amount of cargo is transported to/from Germany via the Port of Rotterdam.</p>

<h4>
<a id="belgium" class="anchor" href="#belgium" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Belgium</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Kingdom of Belgium</a> (<em>Koninkrijk België</em> in Dutch, <em>Royaume de Belgique</em> in French, <em>Königreich Belgien</em> in German) is a federal constitutional monarchy. The current monarch is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_of_Belgium" target="_blank">King Philippe</a>, who ascended the throne in 2013.</p>

<p>There is a national government, but much of the power is devloved to the various sub-national governments. Most important are the governments of the three regions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Region" target="_blank">Flanders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia" target="_blank">Wallonia</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels" target="_blank">Brussels-Captial Region</a>. Flanders is mostly Dutch-speaking. Wallonia is mostly French-speaking, with a German-speaking region in the extreme east (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupen-Malmedy" target="_blank">Eupen-Malmedy</a>). Brussels is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, but in reality mostly French speaking. Other than these three sub-national governments, there is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_French_Community" target="_blank">Government of the French Community</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_German-speaking_Community" target="_blank">Government of the German-speaking Community</a>. (The government of Flanders is also the government of the the Dutch-speaking Community.) Belgium did not suffer too badly during its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation" target="_blank">589 days without an elected federal government</a> in 2010–2011, because so much power is devolved to the various sub-national governments.</p>

<p>Flanders and Wallonia have five provinces each. From west to east, the provinces that border the Netherlands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Flanders" target="_blank">West-Vlaanderen</a> (West Flanders), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Flanders" target="_blank">Oost-Vlaanderen</a> (East Flanders), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_(province)" target="_blank">Antwerpen</a> (Antwerp), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburg_(Belgium)" target="_blank">Limburg</a> in Flanders, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge_(province)" target="_blank">Liège</a> in Wallonia.</p>

<p>The official languages of Belgium are Dutch, French, and German. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish" target="_blank">Belgian Standard Dutch</a> is phonetically noticeably different from Netherlands Standard Dutch, and there are some lexical differences, but grammatically they are both based on the urban dialects of Holland. 'Flemish' can refer to either Belgian Standard Dutch, or the local Flemish dialects of Dutch. The same can be said of the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_French" target="_blank">Belgian Standard French</a> and French Standard French, and 'Wallonian'. German is spoken natively by less than 1% of the population.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Belgium" target="_blank">Language is a delicate political issue</a> in Belgium. Historically, the minority French language had all the political power. These days, the Flemish government and Wallonian government make little concessions for each other's language. For example, on road signs in Flanders, names of places in Wallonia (and France) often only appear in their Dutch version, and similarly, in Wallonia, names of places in Flanders often only appear in their French version. Sometimes the Dutch name and the French name of the same place can look (and sound) very different. For example, the Wallonian city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons" target="_blank"><em>Mons</em></a> is known as <em>Bergen</em> in Dutch. The Flemish city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp" target="_blank">Antwerp</a> is known as <em>Antwerpen</em> in Dutch, but <em>Anvers</em> in French. For foreigners travelling in Belgium, it is advisable to be versed in the place names in Belgium, and also nearby regions, in both Dutch and French, and perhaps also German. For example, the nearby French city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille" target="_blank"><em>Lille</em></a> (which was originally Flemish) is known as <em>Rijsel</em> in Dutch. The nearby German city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen" target="_blank"><em>Aachen</em></a> is known as <em>Aken</em> in Dutch, and <em>Aix-la-Chapelle</em> in French. The Wallonian city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge" target="_blank"><em>Liège</em></a> is known as <em>Luik</em> in Dutch, and <em>Lüttich</em> in German.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the ex-Belgian colonies gained independence as (what are now known as) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" target="_blank">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda" target="_blank">Rwanda</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi" target="_blank">Burundi</a>. They all have French as their official language, or one of their official languages. (Dutch did not have prestige in Belgium at that time.)</p>

<p>The capital of Belgium is Brussels. (Flanders and Wallonia were on the verge of separation a number of times in the past, except that neither wanted to lose Brussels.) Many international and European organisations are based in Brussels, e.g. NATO, European Commission.</p>

<p>Belgium is traditionally Roman Catholic. However, these days few people are actively involved in religion. Flanders are somewhat more religious than Brussels and Wallonia.</p>

<p>Belgium is also relatively socially progressive. Belgium was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Belgium" target="_blank">second country in the world</a> to legalised same-gender marriage. (In 2016) the preceding prime minister is openly gay. The possession of a very small ammount of cannibis/marijuana is legal in Belgium, but it is not sold as openly in Belgium as it is in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Belgium is the second largest trading partner of the Netherlands. Antwerp is the most important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_diamond_district" target="_blank">diamond trading centre</a> in the world.</p>

<p>The highest land point in Belgium is 694m above sea level, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_de_Botrange" target="_blank">Signal de Botrange</a> in the extreme east of the country. There is a pub, and a communication tower with a viewing area.</p>

<h4>
<a id="luxembourg" class="anchor" href="#luxembourg" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Luxembourg</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" target="_blank">Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</a> (<em>Groussherzogtum Lëtzebuerg</em> in Luxembourgish, <em>Grand-Duché de Luxembourg</em> in French, <em>Großherzogtum Luxemburg</em> in German) is sandwiched between Belgium, Germany, and France. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_era" target="_blank">Napoleonic era</a>, the kings of the Netherlands were also the grand dukes of Luxembourg. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">King William III of the Netherlands</a> died in 1890, due to differences in the succession laws of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, in the Netherlands the throne was passed to his daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Queen Wilhelmina</a>, but in Luxembourg to his [17th cousin once removed through male line, or wife's half-uncle] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe,_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg" target="_blank">Grand Duke Adolphe</a>. (Grand Duke Adolphe was earlier the Duke of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Nassau" target="_blank">Nassau</a>, until the annexation of the Duchy of Nassau by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" target="_blank">Kingdom of Prussia</a> in 1866. The monarchs of the Netherlands and Luxembourg are both senior members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Nassau" target="_blank">House of Nassau</a>.) Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy, and the current monarch is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri,_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg" target="_blank">Grand Duke Henri</a>, who ascended the throne in 2000. He is the first cousin of King Philippe of Belgium. The royal families of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands are very close to each other in multiple ways.</p>

<p>The official languages of Belgium are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourgish_language" target="_blank">Luxembourgish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" target="_blank">French</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" target="_blank">German</a>. Unlike Belgium, where language use is mostly geographically-based, in Luxembourg basically all citizens are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism_in_Luxembourg" target="_blank">multilingual</a> in at least two or three languages; all three languages are introduced to children before secondary school. The law is in French. Luxembourg has a huge immigrant population; 20% of the population speak English at work, school, or at home, and 20% of the population Portuguese.</p>

<p>The capital of Luxembourg is Luxembourg City. Many European institutions are based in Luxembourg City, e.g. Court of Justice of the European Union, General Secretariat of the European Parliament.</p>

<p>Luxembourg is somewhat less socially-progressive than the Netherlands and Belgium. Drugs are illegal. Same-gender marriage was legalised much later (2015). Nonetheless, currently (2016; since December 2013), the prime minister and the deputy prime minister of Luxembourg, from two different political parties, are both openly gay; basically no one in Luxembourg cares about the sexual orientation of politicians.</p>

<p>European Netherlands is within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a>. The Schengen Area also includes Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Metropolitan France, and other countries. Within the Schengen Area, there are no systematic border checks on the borders amongst the member states. However, you could still be stopped at or near the border, and asked for identification by the police, just like how you can be asked anywhere else in the country. In the Netherlands, it is compulsory to show your ID in certain situations (see <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/identification-documents/contents/compulsory-identification" target="_blank">what the government says</a> on this issue).</p>

<a id="european-union" class="anchor" href="#european-union" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>European Union</h3>

<p>Amongst the countries and territories discussed above, some are within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" target="_blank">European Union</a> (EU), and some are not. Amongst the dependencies of member states, some are classed as Outermost regions (OMR), and some are classed as Overseas countries and territories (OCT). OMRs are within the European Union, and most European Union regulations apply there. On the other hand, OCTs are outside the European Union; they have special relationships with EU member states, and fewer EU regulations apply there.</p>

<p>Currently (2016), the following are within the European Union:</p>
<ul>
	<li>European Netherlands</li>
	<li>Germany</li>
	<li>Belgium</li>
	<li>Luxembourg</li>
	<li>France: 18 regions, plus Saint-Martin</li>
	<li>Republic of Ireland</li>
	<li>United Kingdom, including Gibraltar</li>
	<li>[and others]</li>
</ul>
<p>Overseas countries and territories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Caribbean Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, Sint-Maarten</li>
	<li>French territories except Saint-Martin</li>
	<li>Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey</li>
	<li>British territories except Gibraltar</li>
	<li>[and others]</li>
</ul>

<p>See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_state_territories_and_the_European_Union" target="_blank">Special member state territories and the European Union</a>. As for Dutch Caribbean, people there have the same Dutch nationality as people in European Netherlands, and they are also citizens of the European Union, and enjoy freedom of movement within the European Union.</p>

<p>United Kingdom voted in June 2016 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit" target="_blank">leave the European Union</a>. Formal procedures have not yet been started (August 2016), and the United Kingdom remains part of the European Union until it leaves the European Union. Parts of the United Kingdom voted to remain in the European Union, and some parts might secede from the United Kingdom.</p>
