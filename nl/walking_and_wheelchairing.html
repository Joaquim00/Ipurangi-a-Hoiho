<p>Walking and wheelchairing, and also some comments on the nature reserves in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>For both walkers and wheelchairers, the Netherlands and the rest of Continental Europe have right-hand traffic. Remember to <strong>look left first</strong>, and then look right, before crossing the road, if it is clear on both sides. Strips of road surface with red bricks/asphalt, or painted in red-brick/asphalt colour, are often bicycle paths; bicycles can run pass in high speeds. Cyclists can come in from both directions. Be careful around tram tracks. Take care at train level crossings.</p>

<p>The emergency number in the Netherlands is <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/alarmnummer-112" target="_blank"><strong>112</strong></a>. (Methods for <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/alarmnummer-112/vraag-en-antwoord/112-bellen-doven-slechthorenden" target="_blank">deaf/less-hearing</a> people; read this well now before you need it.) 112 is also valid in other countries of the European Union. (GSM phones from other countries might also recognise the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number" target="_blank">emergency telephone numbers</a> in other countries, and then redirect that to 112 if you are in European countries. But do not rely on that.)</p>

<a id="walking" class="anchor" href="#walking" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Walking</h3>
<p>Walking is a pleasant way to explore the Netherlands. <em>Wandelen</em> is recreational walking. Many places have signposted walks that you can follow. (Signage is often – but not necessarily – good. Bring your own GPS, especially for walks outside urban areas.) Some are easy short walks, while others are hiking paths that run the length of the country.</p>

<p><a href="http://wandelnet.nl/" target="_blank">Wandelnet.nl</a> has various information on the <em>wandelpaden</em> 'walking/hiking paths' in the Netherlands. This is an <a href="http://wandelnet.wandelen123.nl/" target="_blank">electronic map</a> by them, but for only some parts of the country. <a href="https://www.wandel.nl/" target="_blank">Wandel.nl</a> is also another good website for <em>wandelen</em> in the Netherlands. Three types of longer-distance hiking paths are often encountered.</p>

<p>The first type is the <em>LAW</em> (<em>Lange-Afstand-Wandelpad</em> 'long distance hiking path'). LAW's often cover the length or width of the entire country. For instance, LAW 6, the <em>Grote Rivierenpad</em> 'Big Rivers Trail', runs from Kleve in Germany, near the Rhine and the Dutch border, west to Hoek van Holland on the Hollandic coast, crisscrossing various distributaries of the Rhine River. LAW's are symbolised by a white-on-red rectangle, like a Polish flag. The following are two examples of (inconspicuously placed) LAW symbols along LAW's.</p>

</figure>

<figure>
	<a href="images/foot_02_LAW_2.JPG" target="_blank"> <img src="images/foot_02_LAW_2.JPG" alt="foot_02_LAW_2.JPG" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:0px"> </a>
</figure>

<p>The second type is the <em>Streekpad</em>. <em>Steekpaden</em> are also long-distance, but they are regionally based, and often form loops. <em>Steekpaden</em> are symbolised by a yellow-on-red rectangle, like a Kannada flag.</p>

<figure>
	<a href="images/foot_03_SP_1.JPG" target="_blank"> <img src="images/foot_03_SP_1.JPG" alt="foot_03_SP_1.JPG" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:0px"> </a>
</figure>

<p>The third type is the <a href="http://www.ns.nl/dagje-uit/wandelen" target="_blank"><em>NS wandeling</em></a> 'Dutch Rail walk'. NS walks typically start and end at railway stations, and they often consist of sections of LAW's. Hence they are also simbolised by a white-on-red rectangle, but they have an extra NS symbol on it. The top arrow in the following example is a NS walk symbol.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.wandelkalender.nl/" target="_blank">Wandelkalender.nl</a> gives information on walking events. There are many walking events in the Netherlands. Amongst the 'hardcore' walking events, the <a href="http://www.4daagse.nl/en/" target="_blank">Vierdaagse</a> in Nijmegen is the most famous. It takes place in July each year, and it attracts a huge crowd of walkers, many from foreign countries. During the four days, each day walkers walk on designated routes of 30/40/50/55 km (which categories you are allowed join depends on your age and gender). There is also a military category for local and foreign military personnel. Sort out accomodation in Nijmegen or surrounding areas well in advance. During that week, there is extra public transport to/from/within the entire Arnhem-Nijmegen region, both for the walkers commuting from elsewhere, and also the hordes of partygoers to/from Nijmegen at night. Driving to Nijmegen is not recommended, as many roads are blocked, and parking will also be difficult.</p>

<p>Another popular activity is <em>wadlopen</em> '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflat_hiking" target="_blank">mudflat hiking</a>'. It is possible to walk across to some of the Wadden Sea islands (Frisian islands) during low tide. There is more risk waddling in sea mud than walking on dry land, so only go with an experienced guide. A list of companies offering such tours can be found in <a href="http://www.waddenwandelen.nl/en/p/waddenwandelen/wadlopen/" target="_blank">Waddenwandelen.nl</a>. The <a href="http://www.waddenwandelen.nl/en/p/plan-je-route/" target="_blank">Waddenwandelen.nl</a> website itself also offers information on walks on the Northern mainland coast, and on the Wadden Sea Islands, including Borkum (Germany).</p>

<a id="wheelchairing" class="anchor" href="#wheelchairing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wheelchairing</h3>
<p>Wheelchair accessibility seems to be not too bad in the Netherlands, at least in comparison with many other countries. (Of cause there is room for improvement.) This is what <a href="http://www.holland.com/global/tourism/article/disabled-travelers.htm" target="_blank">Holland.com</a> and <a href="https://www.angloinfo.com/netherlands/how-to/netherlands-healthcare-people-with-disabilities" target="_blank">Angloinfo.com</a> say about accessible travel in the Netherlands. <a href="http://www.accessibletravelnl.com/" target="_blank">Accessibletravelnl.com</a> is a company specialising in tours for people with special accessibility needs. Also, e.g., see their page on <a href="http://www.accessibletravelnl.com/travel/Bikes-for-limited-mobility-" target="_blank">bicycle-type vehicles</a> that are suitable for people with special accessibility needs. (Handbikes are not uncommonly seen in the Netherlands.)</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://www.rolstoelroute.nl/wandelingen.html" target="_blank">one list</a> of accessible <em>wandelpaden</em>, here is <a href="http://www.ferianto.nl/index.php/rolstoelpaden/" target="_blank">another one</a>. Some words on <a href="http://www.atlasvanzorgvakantie.nl/rolstoelvakanties-in-nederland/rolstoeltoegankelijke-stranden-in-nederland/" target="_blank">accessible beaches</a>, and <a href="http://rolstoeltoegankelijkerestaurants.nl/" target="_blank">accessible restaurants</a>. <a href="http://www.rolstoelgebruiker.nl/" target="_blank">A webstie</a> for wheelchair users on vacations within the Netherlands and in other European countries. Here are some words that might help you to do your own search online:</p>

<a id="nature-reserves" class="anchor" href="#nature-reserves" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nature reserves</h3>

<p>Every province has its own <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinciale_Landschappen#De_Landschappen" target="_blank">non-governmental foundation for nature reserves</a>, called <em>[something] Landschap</em> or <em>Landschap [something]</em>, except for Frisia, which has an association with a Frisian name: <a href="http://www.itfryskegea.nl/" target="_blank"><em>It Fryske Gea</em></a>. They maintain their own bridle path networks.</p>
