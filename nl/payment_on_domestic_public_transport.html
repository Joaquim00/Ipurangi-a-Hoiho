<p>The use of contactless smart card fare collection is not as advanced as in East Asia (the Dutch system developed out of the Hong Kong system, according to <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/OV-chipkaartsysteem#Ontwikkeling" target="_blank">this</a>), but at least in the Netherlands there is one unified system for the whole country. The <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart</a> can be used for most public transport in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>There are two types of OV-chipkaarts: disposable ones, and durable ones. Disposable OV-chipkaarts – or 'paper OV-chipkaarts' – come in the form of a piece of thick paper with a chip inside, and they are issued for short term trips like single tickets, return tickets, hour tickets, or day tickets. They have the details printed on one side of it, and the (printed and digital) details cannot be altered once issued. Machine-issued- and over-the-counter- international tickets also come in the form of a disposable OV-chipkaart in the Netherlands. (Dutch Public transport e-tickets, and tickets issued by foreign transport companies for travel in the Netherlands are also valid in the Netherlands.) Domestic disposable OV-chipkaart train tickets has a surcharge of €1 per ticket. Certain chain stores sell discounted train tickets periodically; they typically come in the form of a disposable OV-chipkaart, or as an e-ticket.</p>
<p>Durable OV-chipkaarts – or 'plastic OV-chipkaarts' – is in the form of a pasltic card with a chip in it, and it can be topped up with credit (money), and can have various travel products (e.g. discount subscriptions, bicycle day tickets, surcharges) loaded into them. A OV-chipkaart costs a hefty €7.50 per card (in 2016); the €7.50 is just the purchasing price of the card, and there is no deposit on the card itself. Sometimes transport operators provide free OV-chipkaarts if you purchase certain travel products with them (e.g. discount subscriptions). There are two types of durable OV-chipkaarts: anonymous OV-chipkaart, and personal OV-chipkaart. A personal OV-chipkaarts has the owner's photo and details on it, and has certain advantages over anonymous OV-chipkaart. When you purchase subscriptions from public transport providers, you'll likely be provided with a personal OV-chipkaart.</p> 
<p>You must check in at the beginning of your journey, <strong>and</strong> check out at the end of your journey, by tapping the card at the card reader. With metros and trains, you do not need to check out and in again if you change lines (including replacement buses) <strong>of the same public transport provider</strong>. (However, there are <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/transfer-to-another-ns-train.html" target="_blank">four stations in Noord-Holland</a> where the design is such that you have to check-out-and-in again to reach another platform... read that page carefully about what the consequencies are if you have to change trains there.) On the other hand, you <strong>do</strong> need to check out and in again if you change lines of another provider, and each provider has their own card readers (except for Breng trains, which uses Arriva card readers), which can be found side-by-side on the platform. If you leave a station, instead of just change trains at the station, it is best not to use the card readers on the platform, because there could be gates at the station hall that you open by checking out at the gate.</p>

<figure>
	<figcaption>There are closed gates at the station hall(s) at Arnhem Centraal. There are check-in gates for NS (yellow), and Arriva/Breng (red). (If you get it wrong, you can still 'transfer' inside, but try to get it correct beforehand.) There are wider channels for, e.g., wheelchairs, bicycles. Also featuring an NS staff helping a person stuck inside (in the middle). Obviously, you can only go through channels with a green arrow. The gates are hard to jump over or forcibly open; I have seen young men trying to do so with major difficulties, while security guards look on from afar.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Card readers on a platform. If it says <em>overstappen</em> 'transfer', it is meant to be used only for transfer to another company. Do not use these if you are leaving a station, because there could be closed gates at the station hall.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Not many stations have trains of more than one company. Arnhem Centraal and some others have two companies. (Zutphen has three). If you transfer to another company, use these card-reader poles at the platform: first check out with the first company, then check in with the second company. If you are traveling with an E-ticket, these poles can't read E-tickets, and I suppose there is nothing you have to do. (E-tickets have fixed-trajectories, and/or they are all-you-can-eat tickets, so in theory it doesn't matter.)</figcaption>

<figure>
	<figcaption>In a smaller station like Arnhem Velperpoort, the only check-in/-out facilities are the check-in/-out poles on the platform. (I guess:) if the check-in/-out poles on the platform do not say <ins>overstappen</ins> above them, then it is 'safe' to use them to check-out of a station.</figcaption>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.ns.nl/reisinformatie/reizen-met-ov-chipkaart/stations-met-gesloten-poortjes.html" target="_blank">a list of NS stations with closed gates</a> (the corresponding English page is not necessarily as up-dated). Some other stations have already installed gates, but are not (yet) closed.</p>
<p>Each time you check in with a durable OV-chipkaart, and if you are travelling on credit (i.e. not with some all-you-can-eat subscription or the like), a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/travelling/price-list/boarding-fare-and-basic-fare.htm" target="_blank">deposit of €4/€10/€20</a> (depending on the public transport provider and the type of OV-chipkaart that you have) is deducted from your card. (There are other deposit rates in special cases.) You cannot check in if your card goes under –€4 after the deposit. There are many <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/reloading.htm" target="_blank">methods and places</a> that you can preload the card with money, e.g. machines at train stations, machines at many supermarkets/convienience stores, online.</p>
<p>When travelling with an OV-chipkaart on credit, beyond a flagfall, fare is calculated by <a href="http://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1445324624173/content/assets/ns-nl/klantenservice/spoorkaart-2016.pdf" target="_blank">distance units</a> on most train lines, and usually by actual distance on other public transport (buses etc. have GPS that determins exactly where it has gone). Certain services have a set-charge, e.g. many night buses.</p>
<p>(August 2016:) When you check out, if you encounter a closed gate, make sure that no parts of you (e.g. bicycle, baby-transport, pet on leash, double bass cello) is further forward than the card reader before you tap your OV-chipkaart at the card reader. There are sensors between the gate and the card reader; the gates will not open if there is something in the area between the gate and the card reader. (Your would then have checked-out, but the gates remain closed, and then you cannot check out again because you have checked out, but you are still inside... There should be a help button somewhere within the station, or... yell for help. If there are check-in poles at the platform, you can try checking-in again.)</p>
<p>There is a delay between each time you can check-in and -out. At NS stations, that is 100 seconds, so that you cannot accidentally check-in or -out unintentionally. If you are not sure whether you have checked-in or out (e.g. at places without closed gates), then you can try to tap the card at the card reader again and see whether what it says. (If it doesn't allow you to check-in/-out, it most likely mean that you have already done so in the last 100 seconds. Alternatively, check at the ticket machines for the travel history of your OV-chipkaart.)</p>
<p>Checking out, and then checking in again within 35 minutes is considered a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/travelling/how-does-travelling-work/transfers.htm" target="_blank">transfer</a> (e.g., you do not need to pay another flagfall). If you check in (succesfully) at a station, you can <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/request-a-station-passagepas.html" target="_blank">check out again at the same station within 60 minutes</a>, and the deposit is immediately refunded to your OV-chipkaart as you check out.</p>
<p>Train ticket machines no longer sell discounted tickets. So, the deal is that people with NS subscriptions can take along up to three people during off-peak hours and they enjoy 40% off their train fares. However, those co-riders must now have their own durable OV-chipkaarts; they can no longer get their 40%-off train tickets from the ticket machines. See <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/combined-travel-discount.html" target="_blank">here</a> for explanations.</p>
<p>When buying train tickets between two destinations with more than one reasonable trajectory, especially if one involves non-NS operators, then the NS ticket machine would ask you which trajectory you want to take, tell you how much each costs, and which operators you are allowed to travel with on that ticket. The machine would also give you the option of paying the higher price, and that ticket allows you to take whichever trajectory. For example, from the east of the country: a) from Nijmegen to Enschede, the more-expensive option is catching only NS and change once in Deventer, and the slightly cheaper option is catching NS to Zutphen, then Syntus to Hengelo, and then NS to Enschede; b) from Arnhem to Dordrecht, the more-expensive option is catching only NS and go via Utrecht/Rotterdam, or via Breda, and the slightly cheaper option is catching Arriva to Tiel, NS to Geldermalsen, and then Arriva to Dordrecht. (Check with the <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/" target="_blank">NS journey planner</a> to see which option is quicker.) If the ticket machine or the journey planner does not give you the trajectory that you are thinking of, you can always specify a via-station in the ticket machine/journey planner.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, you <strong>must have a valid train ticket before boarding a train</strong> (i.e. you cannot get train tickets onboard a train), or you might have to pay a hefty fine. With buses and trams, you can get a ticket from the driver, or at a dedicated booth that is available inside some trams. The ticket that you get on a bus/tram is a disposable OV-chipkaart with some public transport providers, and just a piece of paper with other providers. Tickets that you get inside a bus/tram are usually more expensive than using a durable OV-chipkaart. On buses/trams, </p>
<p>If you are catching a train, and there is an announcement which says that there is a train detour or replacement bus, then there is nothing different you have to do with your (durable/disposable) OV-chipkaart; just sign-in and -out at the normal locations. Train conductors carry hand-held machines with them, and they can check detour details.</p>
<p>If you forget to check out when traveling with an durable OV-chipkaart (e.g. when there are no closed gates):</p>
<ul>
	<li>NS treins: for ordinary durable OV-chipkaart (i.e. not NS buisness card), you can still check out within 6 hours after checking-in; you can go back to the station and check out. (If the station has gates, either closed or unclosed, you can only check out on the check-out side of the gate.) See what <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/forgotten/forgetting-to-check-in-or-out.html" target="_blank">NS has to say</a> about forgetting to check in and out in general.</li>
	<li>others: See what <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/customer-service/self-service/forgot-to-check-out.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart has to say</a> about forgetting to check out. If you forget to check out after stepping off a bus/tram at a larger interchange with a public transport service centre, staff there may be able to help you check out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OV-chipkaart <strong>cannot</strong> be used on any of the Frisian Islands; in fact, Texel reverted back to not using it. However, nationwide travel products like the Student OV-chipkaart and OV Vrij Jaar are still honoured on the Frisian Islands. The OV-chipkaart can be used on <em>some</em> local cross-border buses/trains. (You'll have to do the research.) OV-chipkaart is also not used in Caribbean Netherlands.</p> 
<p>For more information on the OV-chipkaart, check out <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm" target="_blank">their website</a>. Also check out the 'how-to-use-OV-chipkaart-with-them' pages with the individual public transport providers, e.g. <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart" target="_blank">NS</a>. If you want to know the costs involved when travelling with an OV-chipkaart <em>to the tenth of a cent</em>, trying checking the websites of the individual public transport providers, or try <a href="http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/OV-chipkaart" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_tariff_system_(Netherlands)" target="_blank"><em>strippenkaart</em></a>, and ordinary paper train tickets, have been phased out.</p>
