<a id="ov-chipkaart" class="anchor" href="#ov-chipkaart" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OV-chipkaart: checking-in and -out</h4>

<p>The use of contactless payment is not as advanced as in East Asia (the Dutch contactless smart card system developed out of the Hong Kong Octopus system, according to <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/OV-chipkaartsysteem#Ontwikkeling" target="_blank">this</a>), but at least in the Netherlands there is one unified system for the whole country. The <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart</a> can be used for most public transport in the Netherlands: on most trains, light-rail, trams, metros, trolleybuses, most buses, and some ferries.</p>

<h5>Types of OV-chipkaart</h5>
<p>There are two types of OV-chipkaarts: disposable ones, and durable ones. A disposable OV-chipkaarts, or 'paper OV-chipkaart', comes in the form of a piece of thick paper with a chip inside, and they are issued for short term trips like single tickets, return tickets, hour tickets, or day tickets. They have the ticket details printed on one side of it, and the ticket details (printed and digital) cannot be altered once issued. Machine-issued- and over-the-counter- international tickets also come in the form of a disposable OV-chipkaart in the Netherlands. Disposable OV-chipkaart train tickets for domestic trips have a surcharge of €1 per ticket. Other than the railway companies, certain chain stores sell discounted train tickets periodically; they typically come in the form of a disposable OV-chipkaart, or as an e-ticket.</p>

<p>A durable OV-chipkaart, or 'plastic OV-chipkaart', or just 'OV-chipkaart', is in the form of a pasltic card with a chip in it. It can be topped up with credit (money in euros), and can have various travel products (e.g. discount subscriptions, bicycle day tickets, surcharges) loaded into it. A OV-chipkaart normally costs a hefty €7.50 per card (in 2016); the €7.50 is just the purchasing price of the card, and it does not even include a deposit (there is no deposit on the card itself). There are two types of durable OV-chipkaarts: <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/apply-1/anonymous-ov-chipkaart.htm" target="_blank">anonymous OV-chipkaart</a>, and <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/apply-1/personal-ov-chipkaart.htm" target="_blank">personal OV-chipkaart</a>. A personal OV-chipkaart has the owner's photo and details on it, and it has certain advantages over anonymous OV-chipkaart, e.g. lower deposit rates when you check-in (see below), card can be blocked in case of theft. When you purchase subscriptions from public transport providers, you'll likely be provided with a personal OV-chipkaart, probably for free.</p> 

<h5>Checking-in and -out, and transfer</h5>
<p>You must check-in at the beginning of your journey, <strong>and</strong> check-out at the end of your journey, by tapping the card at the card reader. With metros and trains, you do not need to check-out and -in again if you change lines (including replacement buses) <strong>of the same public transport provider</strong>. (However, at <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/transfer-to-another-ns-train.html" target="_blank">Amsterdam Muiderpoort, Amsterdam Zuid, Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA, and Hilversum</a> NS stations, you may have to check-out and -in again to reach different platforms... <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/transfer-to-another-ns-train.html" target="_blank">read carefully</a> about what the monetary consequencies are if you have to check-out and -in again there.) On the other hand, you <strong>do</strong> need to check-out and -in again if you change to lines of another provider; each public transport provider has its own card readers (except for Breng trains, which uses Arriva card readers). For trains, they can be found side-by-side on the platform. If you leave a station (i.e. not just changing trains at the station), and the card readers on the platform say <em>overstappen</em> 'transfer' above them, it is best not to use the card readers on the platform, because there could be gates at the station hall that you can only open by checking-out at the gate.</p>

<figure>
	<figcaption>Closed gates at Arnhem Centraal: for NS (yellow), and Arriva/Breng (red). (If you get it wrong, you can still 'transfer' inside.) There are wider channels for, e.g., wheelchairs, bicycles. Also featuring an NS staff helping a person stuck inside (foreground in the middle). You can only go through channels with a green arrow.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>The card reader up close. Put the OV-chipkaart, or the barcode of an E-ticket, over the circle. If it is successful, the gates will open. Make sure that you don't place anything (e.g. pram) in the area between the gate and the card reader before checking-in or -out, or else the gate might not open (and you have still checked-in/-out with your card!)</figcaption>

<figure>
	<figcaption>Not many stations have trains of more than one company. Arnhem Centraal and some others have two (domestic) companies. (Zutphen has three). If you transfer to another company, use these card-reader poles at the platform: first check-out with the first company, then check-in with the second company. If you are traveling with an E-ticket, these poles can't read E-tickets, and there is nothing you have to do. (E-tickets have fixed-trajectories, and/or they are all-you-can-eat tickets, so in theory it doesn't matter.)</figcaption>

</figure>

<figure>
	<figcaption>At a smaller station like Arnhem Velperpoort, there are no gates, and the only check-in/-out facilities are the poles on the platform. I suppose, if the poles on the platform do not say <ins>overstappen</ins> above them, then it is 'safe' to use them to check-out of a station.</figcaption>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.ns.nl/reisinformatie/reizen-met-ov-chipkaart/stations-met-gesloten-poortjes.html" target="_blank">a list of NS stations with closed gates</a> (the corresponding English page is not necessarily up-to-date). Some other stations have already installed gates, but are not (yet) closed.</p>

<p>(August 2016:) If you encounter a closed gate, make sure that no parts of you (e.g. bicycle, pram, pet on leash, double bass cello) is further forward than the card reader before you tap your OV-chipkaart on the card reader. There are sensors between the gate and the card reader; the gates will not open if there is something in the area between the gate and the card reader. (If you are checking-out, you would have checked-out, but the gates remain closed, and then you cannot check-out again because you have checked-out, but you are still inside the paid-area... There should be a help button somewhere within the station, or yell for help. If there are check-in poles at the platform, you can try checking-in again there, and then go back to the station hall and try again...)</p>

<p>There is a delay between each time you can check-in and -out. At NS stations, this is 100 seconds. The delay is in place to prevent people from tapping the card twice accidentally, and hence cancelling their check-in/-out. If you are not sure whether you have checked-in or -out (e.g. at places without closed gates), then you can try trapping the card at the card reader again and see what it says. (If it doesn't allow you to check-in/-out, it is most likely the case that you have already done so in the last 100 seconds. Alternatively, you can check the travel history of your OV-chipkaart at a ticket machine.)</p>

<p>Checking-out, and then checking-in again within 35 minutes is considered a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/travelling/how-does-travelling-work/transfers.htm" target="_blank">transfer</a> (e.g., you do not need to pay another flagfall).</p>

<p>If you are catching a train, and there is an announcement which says that there is a train detour or replacement bus, then there is nothing different you have to do with your (durable/disposable) OV-chipkaart; just check-in and -out at the normal locations. Replacement buses often have mobile card readers near them, which you can use if that is the beginning or end of your journey. Train conductors carry hand-held machines, and they can check detour details.</p>

<h5>Cost of using the OV-chipkaart</h5>
<p>Each time you check-in with a durable OV-chipkaart on credit, a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/travelling/price-list/boarding-fare-and-basic-fare.htm" target="_blank">deposit of €4/€10/€20</a> is deducted from your card (depending on the public transport provider and the type of OV-chipkaart that you have). (There are other deposit rates in special cases.) You cannot check-in (including checking-in when you transfer) if your card goes under –€4 (negative four euros) after the deposit. There are many <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/reloading.htm" target="_blank">methods</a> for preloading the card with credit, e.g. machines at train stations, machines at many supermarkets/convienience stores, online.</p>

<p>When travelling with an OV-chipkaart on credit, beyond a flagfall, fare is calculated by <a href="http://www.ns.nl/binaries/_ht_1445324624173/content/assets/ns-nl/klantenservice/spoorkaart-2016.pdf" target="_blank">distance units</a> on most train lines, and by actual distance on most other public transport (buses etc. have GPS that determins exactly where it has gone). Certain services have a set-charge, e.g. many night buses.</p>

<h5>If you forget to check-out</h5>
<p>If you forget to check-out when traveling with a durable OV-chipkaart (e.g. when there are no closed gates):</p>
<ul>
	<li>NS trains: for ordinary durable OV-chipkaart (i.e. not NS buisness card), you can still check-out within 6 hours after checking-in; you can go back to the station and check-out. (If the station has gates, either closed or unclosed, you can only check-out on the check-out side of the gate.) See what <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/customer-service/forgotten/forgetting-to-check-in-or-out.html" target="_blank">NS has to say</a> about forgetting to check-in or -out in general.</li>
	<li>others: See what <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/customer-service/self-service/forgot-to-check-out.htm" target="_blank">OV-chipkaart says</a> about forgetting to check-out. If you forget to check-out after stepping off a bus/tram at a larger interchange, there could be a public transport service centre there, and staff there may be able to help you check-out.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Checking-in and -out at the same station</h5>
<p>If you just want to visit the paid-area behind closed gates (e.g. waving someone goodbye, trainspotting, walking through to the other side of a station, visit shops within the paid-area), you can check-in, and then <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/request-a-station-passagepas.html" target="_blank">check-out at the same station within 60 minutes</a>; the deposit is immediately refunded to- your OV-chipkaart as you check out.</p>

<h5>Samenreiskorting</h5>
<p><strong>Train ticket machines no longer sell discounted tickets</strong>. So, the deal is that people with NS subscriptions can take along up to three people during off-peak hours, and the companions enjoy 40%-off their train fares (the <em>samenreiskorting</em>). However, these companions must now have their own durable OV-chipkaarts. See <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart/combined-travel-discount.html" target="_blank">here</a> for explanations.</p>

<h5>Other issues</h5>
<p>The OV-chipkaart <strong>cannot</strong> be used on any of the Frisian Islands; in fact, Texel reverted back to not using it. However, nationwide travel products like the Student OV-chipkaart and OV Vrij Jaar are still honoured on the Frisian Islands. The OV-chipkaart can be used on <em>some</em> local cross-border buses/trains. (You'll have to do the research.) The OV-chipkaart is also not used in Caribbean Netherlands.</p> 

<p>For more information on the OV-chipkaart, check out <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm" target="_blank">their website</a>. Also check out the 'how-to-use-OV-chipkaart-with-us' pages of the individual public transport providers, e.g. <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/traveling-with-the-ov-chipkaart" target="_blank">NS</a>. If you want to know the costs involved when travelling with an OV-chipkaart <em>to the tenth of a cent</em>, trying checking the websites of the individual public transport providers, or try <a href="http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/OV-chipkaart" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="other-tickets" class="anchor" href="#other-tickets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other tickets, and other ticketing matters</h4>
<p>When buying train tickets between two destinations with more than one reasonable trajectory, especially if one involves non-NS operators, then the NS ticket machine will ask you which trajectory you want to take, tell you how much each costs, and trains of which operators you are allowed to travel on with that ticket. The machine also gives you the option of paying the higher price, and issues you a ticket which allows you to take whichever trajectory. For example, from the east of the country: a) from Nijmegen to Enschede, the more-expensive option is catching only NS trains and change once in Deventer, while the slightly cheaper option is catching NS to Zutphen, then Syntus to Hengelo, and then NS to Enschede; b) from Arnhem to Dordrecht, the more-expensive option is catching only NS and go via Utrecht/Rotterdam, or via Breda, while the slightly cheaper option is catching Arriva to Tiel, NS to Geldermalsen, and then Arriva to Dordrecht. (Check with the <a href="http://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/" target="_blank">NS journey planner</a> to see which option is quicker.) If the ticket machine or the journey planner does not give you the trajectory that you are thinking of, you can always specify a via-station in the ticket machine/journey planner.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, you <strong>must have a valid train ticket before boarding a train</strong> (i.e. you cannot get train tickets onboard a train), or you might have to pay a hefty fine. The chance of encountering a ticket-inspector is quite high. Claiming to be a naïve tourist does not work.</p> 

<p>With buses and trams, you can get a ticket from the driver, or at a dedicated booth that is available inside some trams. The ticket that you get on a bus/tram is a disposable OV-chipkaart with some public transport providers, or just a piece of paper with other providers. Buying a ticket in a bus/tram is usually more expensive than using a durable OV-chipkaart. Read carefully, or ask someone else, whether transfers to another vehicle is permited with that ticket.</p>

<p>Usually, only cash is accepted on buses and trams. However, GVB in Amsterdam has bankcard/creditcard payment on buses and trams. It is said that in 2017, passengers will no longer be able to pay cash on board. GVB is also thinking of not selling tickets on board all together.</p>

<p>There are also various sorts of app-tickets and e-tickets that you have to print out. For trains, you can use the barcode on an app-/e-ticket to open closed gates. Otherwise there is nothing you have to do to gain access to trains.</p>

<p>Tickets issued by foreign train companies for travel in the Netherlands continue to be valid.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_tariff_system_(Netherlands)" target="_blank"><em>strippenkaart</em></a>, and ordinary paper train tickets, have been phased out.</p>
