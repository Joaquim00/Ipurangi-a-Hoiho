<a id="F325" class="anchor" href="#F325" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>F 325</h3>

<p>In late August 2016, I cycled along the F 325, also known as the RijnWaalpad, from Arnhem to Nijmegen for the first time. (Sorry, I am not as fit as I wish; I basically always catch the train between Arnhem and Nijmegen. I cycled between Arnhem and Nijmegen before, but that was before the F 325 was built.) I was not aiming to document my experience of the F 325, so most of the photos I have taken are not what they want to showcase. Here is my experience, of trying to follow F 325 without looking at a map. (Spoiler: I succeeded, but in a slightly warped way.) (See also Bicycle Dutch's <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-f325-fast-cycle-route-arnhem-nijmegen/" target="_blank">2015 review</a> of F 325.)</p>

<p>This is the official <a href="http://www.rijnwaalpad.nl/over-de-snelfietsroute/kaart-rijnwaalpad/totaal-kaart/" target="_blank">route map of F 325</a>. Their map is often a little bit buggy, so I'm also including my rough map of F 325 southbound here; it is rough because I used Google Maps' 'Add biking route' function, and Google Map is not accurate at some places. Also included are the location of the photos, chronologically from north to south. You might want to open the map in a separate window/tab.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1dG7eqt9kZLEDypv8uvKps-WKfgU" width="480" height="640"></iframe>

<p>I started on the eastern Arnhem branch of the F 325, crossing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frost_Bridge" target="_blank">John Frost Bridge</a>, famous for its role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arnhem" target="_blank">Battle of Arnhem</a> during World War II. The first F 325 sign I saw was south of the river. (Unlike at the western branch, where the first F 325 sign is near the railway station.) Both branches are familiar territory for me; beyond that, not so much.</p>

<p id=sharks-teeth>This is the first unfamiliar crossing. The photo faces back north. For both north- and south-bound on the bicycle path, you first encounter shark's teeth (give-way line) telling you to give way to cyclists coming from your left on the first traversing bicycle path. Then you have shark's teeth telling you to give way to cars coming from your left. You then have shark's teeth telling you to give way to cars coming from you right. Then there is no shark's teeth with the following traversing bicycle path; you just have to know to give way to your right, when neither of you have a giveway sign. (Consistency! please...)</p>

<p>I then encountered these folks on the northern side of where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linge" target="_blank">Linge</a> is crossed. They were dressed up as local evacuees during World War II. One of the ladies told me that during one point, the Linge separated the Allies to the south, and the Germans to the north. The Irish was guarding that little bridge, and that little bridge across the Linge on F 325 is called the Irish Guards Bridge. (Also, I didn't know that the <a href="http://www.nijmeegsefiets4daagse.nl/" target="_blank">Nijmeegse Fiets4daagse</a> was happening that day.)</p>

<p>Further along, F 325 next to A 325. It is not close enough to be annoying.</p>

<p>This little detour to cross Bemmelseweg is underwhelming. (The direct route across Bemmelseweg indicated on Google Maps does not exist.)

<p>Sorry, I didn't take any photos of the A 15 underpass, which is what they would want to showcase, with lightings that you can change with their app. Anyway, this photo is taken just to the south of it, facing north. You now know that the heigh restriction is 2.2m.</p>

<p>Google Maps is slightly wrong here: F 325 cuts into Oude Postweg. Signs like these starts to appear from about here. This is the lovely, but slightly confusing section at the village of Ressen. (One of the problematic crossings shown in the Bicycle Dutch video. It is not as problematic going southbound.)</p>

<p>Turn right to Slenkweg. So far signs for F 325 are good.</p>

<p>Pleasant lake view. The houses of Nijmegen Lent are in front of us. I see no signs which say F 325 from Lent onwards. There are very few RijnWaalpad signs from Lent onwards. I had to use my intuitions until I saw Nijmegen Lent station. (The F 325 was officially opened in July 2015! It is now more than one year after that!)</p>

</figure>

<p>The sidestreet in the foreground is Frankrijkstraat. I totally missed the fact (there were no signs) that the next street, Vrouwe Udasingel, was meant to be the branching point for the Nijmegen west branch of F 325 (which I intended to take). Unknowingly, I went along the Nijmegen east branch of F 325.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>I followed the red asphalt right into Laauwikstraat. Going west along Laauwikstraat, I was surprised that I was sharing the narrow street with cars, and buses (even if they were reasonably slow). This photograph is taken facing back east; this is Lentseveld bus stop. Unbeknown to me (there were no signs), F 325 had turned south just before that bus stop. I don't think non-locals who wanted to continue on the Nijmegen east branch have any chance. As for me, I continued my way west, with no direction signs whatsoever.</p>

</figure>

<p>Looking west, this is Nijmegen Lent train station. I'm back in familiar territory. I know that I have to turn left/south to cross the Nijmegen Railway Bridge. At the junction, there were Rijnwaalpad signs. Looking back for signs to Arnhem, I was surprised that the sign to Arnhem pointed to the west, rather than to the east, the path that I took. Anyway, I knew the way from here onwards. (Google Maps is wrong; Nijmegen Lent train station has moved south to right next to the bicycle path junction.</p>

<p>A section of the long row of parked bicycles on Nijmegen Railway Bridge. There are many more under the railway bridge. People are sunning themselves and swimming at the riverfront beaches.</p>

</figure>

<p>Destination. One of the bicycle garages at Nijmegen train station. Bicycle storage, no mopeds, e-bicycle charging spots, oversized bicycles, 1097 free spaces, the sign says.</p>

</figure>

<p>OK, so I have been complaining. But this is already many many times better than nearly all other countries. There is room for improvement, especially at the Nijmegen-end of F 325 (a lot more signage please!), especially given that Nijmegen has just won the award of <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/nijmegen-celebrations/" target="_blank">Cycling City of the Netherlands 2016</a>.</p>
