	<p><em>30-07-2019</em></p>
	<p>Dear friend:<br/>Here are some ways of getting to <em>Arnhem Centraal</em> train station by public transport.</p>
<h4 id="schiphol-airport">From Amsterdam Schiphol AMS</h4>
	<p>Amsterdam Schiphol Airport AMS has its own train station called <em>Schiphol Airport</em>, located one floor below the arrival hall. There are ticket machines in arrival hall, and near the luggage conveyor belts.</p>
	<p>There are no gates at Schiphol Airport station. If you hold a NFC ticket (from a ticket machine, or you have your own OV-chipkaart), then tap the ticket at the yellow/blue card readers near the escalators before you head down to the platforms. If you hold a barcode ticket (from an app, or an e-ticket printed on a piece of A4 paper), then board the train directly. (At stations with gates, there is at least one gate that can read barcode tickets.)</p>
	<p>Usually:<br/></p>
	<ul>
		<li>:00 and :30 past the hour – direct Intercity train to Arnhem Centraal; Nijmegen is the final destination of the train</li>
		<li>:18 and :48 past the hour – catch the Intercity train towards Venlo; about half an hour later, at Utrecht Centraal (a very big station), walk across the platform and board the train towards Arnhem Centraal / Nijmegen.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Check the journey planner at <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">NS</a> (Dutch Rail), especially if you are arriving very earlly or very late in the evening. The normal price of this journey is €18.60 one way. Domestic tickets purchased at ticket machines or counters usually have a €1 surcharge per ticket. (Barcode tickets do not have this surcharge.) There is no senior or student discount, but a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket for 4–11 year olds (inclusive) cost €2.50 (no €1 surcharge).</p>
	<p>If you fly with KLM, there is a free bus between Schiphol Airport and Arnhem. When booking your ticket, put Arnhem (QAR) as the origin and/or destination to include the free bus between Schiphol Airport and Arnhem. Alternatively, if you already have a ticket to/from Amsterdam Schiphol, contact KLM to add this bus journey. However, there are only three buses per day. See the <a href="https://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/plan_and_book/ticket_information/travel_by_train_or_bus_on_a_KLM_ticket/index.htm" target="_blank">timetable and details</a>. The Arnhem bus stop is near the back entrance of Arnhem Centraal train station (on Amsterdamseweg); the bus from Schiphol stops on the southern side of the road (the side of the station entrance), while the bus to Schiphol stops on the northern side of the road (the side opposite the station entrance).</p>
<h4 id="eindhoven-airport">From Eindhoven EIN</h4>
	<p>When arriving at Eindhoven Airport EIN, after you leave the restricted area, there is a Dutch rail yellow/blue ticket machine inside the terminal. A ticket from here includes the bus ride from Eindhoven Airport to Eindhoven station, plus the train ticket from Eindhoven to the destination. In the other direction, you can also buy a ticket to <em>Eindhoven Airport</em>. The best bus to catch is bus 400 or 401.</p>
	<p>If you pay for the bus separately, notice that most buses in the Netherlands do not take cash. On board you have to pay by bank card or credit card. At Eindhoven Airport there are also bus ticket machines near the bus stop. (Not many bus stops have ticket machines near them.)</p>
	<p>At Eindhoven station, catch any northbound Intercity train (destination: Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam / Alkmaar / Schagen / Den Helder, or Amsterdam / Enkhuizen). Catch one stop to 's-Hertogenbosch (a.k.a. Den Bosch). During the day there are six Intercities per hour along this route, and less services early in the morning and in the evening. This Intercity leg takes 18 minutes. At 's-Hertogenbosch, at :24 and :54 past the hour, there is an Intercity to Arnhem Centraal (destination: Zwolle). Often you just need to walk across the platform at 's-Hertogenbosch, but check.</p>
	<p>Check the journey planner at <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">NS</a> (Dutch Rail). The normal price of this journey is €21.44 one way. Domestic tickets purchased at ticket machines or counters usually have a €1 surcharge per ticket. There is no senior or student discount, but a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket for 4–11 year olds (inclusive) cost €2.50 (no €1 surcharge), for the rail portion.</p>
	<p>An alternative for travelling between Eindhoven and Arnhem Centraal train stations is <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank">Flixbus</a>, which is significantly cheaper. However, if you're arriving at Eindhoven airport from elsewhere, it is hard to predict the arrival time of your flight. And there are also not many buses a day between Eindhoven and Arnhem. (Last time I caught Flixbus on this route, it was a night bus, and I was bitten by bugs on the bus.)</p>
<h4 id="rotterdam-airport">From Rotterdam RTM</h4>
	<p>From Rotterdam The Hague Airport RTM, catch bus 33, either directly to Rotterdam Centraal train station, or to Meijersplein metro station and then catch Metro line E to Rotterdam Centraal. There are ticket machines at the airport bus stop. You can also pay onboard, but they do not take cash.</p>
	<p>At Rotterdam Centraal, catch an Intercity train towards Utrecht Centraal (destionation: Utrecht Centraal, Zwolle / Leeuwarden, or Zwolle / Groningen). During day time there are four trains per hour. At Utrecht Centraal, change to an Intercity train to Arnhem Centraal (destionation: Nijmegen). During day time there are four trains per hour.</p>
	<p>Check the journey planner at <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en" target="_blank">NS</a> (Dutch Rail). A RET (Rotterdam public trasport) 2-hour ticket is €4.00. The normal price of the train journey is €19.80 one way. Domestic train tickets purchased at ticket machines or counters usually have a €1 surcharge per ticket. There is no senior or student discount, but a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/railrunner" target="_blank">Railrunner</a> ticket for 4–11 year olds (inclusive) cost €2.50 (no €1 surcharge), for the rail portion.</p>
<h4 id="train-ferry-from-England>Train or ferry from England</h4>
	<p>See <a href="http://hilario.bambooradical.com/benelux/netherlands.html#england" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>With Eurostar, see what route the ticket tells you to take. The route that has the best price–time balance, if booked at least 7 days in advance, is Eurostar to Brussels, and then an hourly Intercity from Brussels to Breda (direction: Den Haag HS or Amsterdam Centraal), and then a half-hourly Intercity from Breda to Arnhem Centraal (direction: Zwolle). (With Intercities, you can travel on any Intercity service during the day. With Eurostar or Thalys, you are typically restricted to a particular service.)</p>
	<p>If you arrive on the Harwich – Hoek van Holland ferry, currently RET (Rotterdam public transport) runs replacement buses between Hoek van Holland and Schiedam Centrum train station. (Bus 711 is faster, bus 713 is a lot slower.) Schiedam Centrum is one train station west of Rotterdam Central, and there are eight trains per hour to Rotterdam Centraal (destinations: Dordrecht, or Vlissingen). At Rotterdam Centraal, catch a quater-hourly Intercity to Utrecht Centraal (destination: Utrecht Centraal, Zwolle / Leeuwarden, or Zwolle / Groningen), and then a quater-hourly Intercity of Arnhem Centraal (destination: Nijmegen).</p>
<h4 id="weeze-airport">Düsseldorf Weeze NRN</h4>
	<p>Weeze Airport NRN is geographically closest to Arnhem, but is not necessarily easiest to get to.</p>
	<p>Option A: cheapest, entire way on normal German public transport. Take the hourly bus SW1 from Weeze Air Terminal 1 to Weeze Bahnhof (train station), train RE10 northbound to the last station Kleve (i.e. Cleves), bus SB58 westbound to the last stop Emmerich Bahnhof (train station), and then the hourly train RE19 northwestbound to the last station Arnhem Centraal. The entire journey takes about 2.5 hours.</p>
	<p>You can buy one ticket for the entire way from the bus driver at Weeze Airport (tell the driver <em>nach Arnheim</em> 'to Arnhem'), or buy one beforehand through the app or website of <a href="https://www.vrr.de/de/startseite/" target="_blank">VRR</a>. It is priced at price-level C (one-way adult €12.80, child €1.70).</p>
	<p>Option B: Shuttle between Weeze Airport and Nijmegen train station, see <a href="https://www.airport-weeze-shuttle.de/en/time-table-nijmegen" target="_blank">details</a>. Has to be booked 24 hours ahead. Adult €18 one-way, €30 return. Child €12 one-way, €20 return. There are normaly ten trains per hour between Nijmegen and Arnhem Centraal. Adult €4.50 one way, child €2.50 for a day ticket.</p>
	<p>A shuttle can also be chartered to Arnhem, costing €90 per vehicle, or €18 per person from 6 people upwards. However, the pick-up / drop-off point in Arnhem is at Gelredome (statium), and you need another bus ride to Arnhem Centraal train station.</p>
<h4 id="duesseldorf-airport">Düsseldorf DUS</h4>
	<p>Notice that Düsseldorf Airport DUS has two train stations: The station <em>Düsseldorf Flughafen Terminal</em> that is underneath the terminal is only served by S-bahn trains (city trains) towards Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof (main station). Instead you need to take the <em>skytrain</em> to the main-line train station <em>Düsseldorf Flughafen</em>. From there you can catch the hourly RE19 to the northern terminus Arnhem Centraal.</p>
	<p>You buy a ticket before boarding the skytrain, or buy one beforehand through the app or website of <a href="https://www.vrr.de/de/startseite/" target="_blank">VRR</a>. It is priced at price-level D (one-way adult €15.70, child €1.70), which is valid for the entire VRR area.</p>
